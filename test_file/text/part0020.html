<p class="c6"><img src="../images/00004.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="c7"><strong class="calibre6">W</strong><small class="calibre7">E FACE POTENTIAL</small> death every day. We could get cancer, get eaten away by bacteria, or get infected with a deadly virus. And several times a day, our lives are saved. Strangely mutated cells are destroyed, fungal spores are eliminated, bacteria are peppered with holes, and viruses are sliced in two. This agreeable service is provided by our immune system, with its many little cells. Its workforce includes experts at spotting foreign bodies, contract killers, hatters, and mediators. They all work hand in hand, and together they are a pretty top team.</p>
<p class="c8">The vast majority of our immune system (about 80 percent) is located in the gut. And with good reason. This is where the main stage at the bacterial Woodstock is situated, and any immune system worth its salt must be there or be square. The bacteria are confined to a fenced-off area—the mucus membrane of the gut—preventing them from getting too dangerously close to the cells of the gut wall. The immune system can play with the cells without ever posing a danger to the body. This allows our defender cells to get acquainted with many previously unknown species.</p>
<p class="c8">If, sometime later and elsewhere in the body, an immune cell encounters a now-familiar bacterium, it can react to it <a id="page_153" class="calibre2"></a>much more quickly. The immune system has to be extremely careful in the gut, suppressing its defensive instincts and allowing the many bacteria there to live in peace. But, at the same time, it must also recognize dangerous elements in the crowd and weed them out. If we decided to say “Hi” to each of our gut bacteria individually, we might just manage it in around 3 million years. Our immune system not only says, “Hi,” it also says, “You’re okay,” or “I’d prefer to see you dead.”</p>
<p class="c8">Also, strange as it may sound, the immune system must be able to distinguish between bacterial cells and the body’s own human cells. That is easier said than done. Some bacteria have structures on their surface that bear a close resemblance to those on the surface of our own cells. This is the reason why, for example, scarlet fever should be treated immediately with antibiotics. If it is not treated quickly, the immune system can begin to mistake the cells of the joints or other organs for the bacteria that cause scarlet fever and attack them. It might suddenly think our knee is a nasty sore-throat germ hiding out in our leg. It happens rarely—but it does happen.</p>
<p class="c8">Scientists have observed a similar effect in patients with juvenile diabetes. Also called diabetes mellitus type 1, this condition results from the autoimmune destruction of the cells that produce insulin. One possible cause is a breakdown of communication with the bacteria of the gut. It may be that they are failing to train the immune system properly or the immune system is somehow getting the message wrong.</p>
<p class="c8">The body actually has a very rigorous set of measures designed to guard against such communication breakdowns and cases of mistaken identity. Before an immune cell is allowed to enter the bloodstream, it has to complete the toughest boot camp of any cells. Among other things, it must cover a vast distance while being constantly confronted with various structures of the body. If our little immune cell encounters <a id="page_154" class="calibre2"></a>something it cannot clearly identify as belonging to the body or coming from outside, it stops and prods at it a little. That is a fatal error: this cell will never graduate to the bloodstream.</p>
<p class="c8">In this way, immune cells with a tendency to attack the body’s own tissue are weeded out before they leave boot camp. In their training center in the gut, they learn to be tolerant of foreign bodies, or rather, they learn to be better prepared for an encounter with them. This system works rather well and usually without untoward incidents.</p>
<p class="c8">There is one lesson that is particularly tricky to learn: what to do about foreign bodies that aren’t actually bacteria but remind the immune system of them? Red blood cells, for example, have very bacteria-like proteins on their surface. Our immune system would attack our own blood if it had not learned in boot camp that the blood is a no-go area. If our blood cells have the blood-group marker A on their surface, we have no problem receiving transfusions of blood from donors with the same blood group. The reasons for needing a transfusion can be diverse, from a motorbike accident to heavy blood loss during childbirth.</p>
<p class="c8">However, we cannot receive blood from donors whose blood cells have a different blood-group marker on their surface. It would immediately remind our immune system of bacteria, and since the immune system knows that bacteria have no business being in the bloodstream, it would consider the donated blood cells an enemy and cause the cells to form clumps. If it weren’t for this combat readiness—learned through training by our gut bacteria—there would be no blood groups and any donor could give blood to any recipient. For newborn babies, who do not yet <a id="page_156" class="calibre2"></a>have many bacteria in their guts, this is indeed the case. They can theoretically receive transfusions of blood from any group without any incompatibility effects. (As a precaution, hospitals give babies blood from the mother’s blood group, since antibodies from the mother can find their way into the baby’s bloodstream.) As soon as babies begin to develop a rudimentary immune system and gut flora, they can only tolerate blood from their own group.</p>

<p class="c18"><em class="calibre8">If antibodies match with foreign blood cells, the cells will form clumps. Blood group B has antibodies against blood group A.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="c8">Blood-group development is just one of many immunological phenomena caused by bacteria. There are probably many more waiting to be discovered. Much of what bacteria do tends to be fine tuning. Each kind of bacteria has its own way of affecting the immune system. Some species have been observed to make our immune system more tolerant, for example, by causing more peace-loving, mediatory immune cells to be produced, or by affecting our cells in a similar way to cortisone and other anti-inflammatory drugs. That results in a milder, less belligerent immune system. This is probably a clever move on the part of these tiny creatures, since it increases their chances of being tolerated in the gut.</p>
<p class="c8">The fact that the small intestines of young vertebrates (including humans) have been found to contain bacteria that provoke the immune system leaves room for speculation. Could it be the case that these provocateurs help keep the bacteria population in the small intestine down? That would make the small intestine an area of low bacteria tolerance, giving it some peace and quiet for a while. The provocateurs themselves do not hang out in the mucus membrane like good little bacteria, but dock firmly onto the villi of the small intestine. A similar preference is shown by pathogens such as harmful versions of <em class="calibre8">E. coli.</em> When they want to colonize the small intestine, but find their favorite places occupied by such provocateurs, they have no choice but to leave.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_157" class="calibre2"></a>This effect is known as colonization resistance. The majority of the microbes in our gut protect us simply by occupying spaces that would otherwise be free for harmful bacteria to colonize. Incidentally, the provocateurs of the small intestine belong to that group of characters that refuse to be cultivated outside the gut. How can we be sure that they are not actually harming us? Well, we can’t. It is possible that they do harm some people by overstimulating the immune system. Many questions remain to be answered.</p>
<p class="c8">Some of those questions might be answered with the help of a group of germ-free mice in a New York laboratory. They are the cleanest creatures in the world: they come into the world via sterile cesarean births, they live in antiseptic cages, and they eat steam-sterilized food. Disinfected animals like these could never exist in nature. Anyone working with these mice must take the utmost care, since even unfiltered air teems with flying germs. The mice allow researchers to watch what happens to an immune system that has nothing to do. What goes on in a gut with no microbes? How does an untrained immune system react to pathogens? What differences are so obvious they can be seen by the naked eye?</p>
<p class="c8">Anyone who has ever had anything to do with such animals will tell you—germ-free mice are weird. They are often hyperactive and exhibit an un-mouse-like lack of caution. They eat more than their germ-colonized peers and take longer to digest their food. They have hugely enlarged appendixes, shriveled digestive tracts with few villi and blood vessels, and a reduced number of immune cells. They are easy prey for even relatively harmless pathogens.</p>
<p class="c8">Feeding them with cocktails of bacteria taken from other mice produces astonishing results. If they are given bacteria from mice with type 2 diabetes, they soon begin to develop problems metabolizing sugar. If bacteria from obese humans <a id="page_158" class="calibre2"></a>are fed to germ-free mice, the mice are more likely to gain weight than if they receive bacteria from people in the normal weight range. Scientists can also administer a single species of bacteria to observe its effect on the mice. Some bacteria, acting alone, can reverse the effects of the sterile environment—cranking up the immune system, shrinking the mice’s swollen appendixes down to normal size, and normalizing their eating behavior. Other lone bacteria have no effect whatsoever. Yet others take effect only in cooperation with colleagues from other bacteria families.</p>
<p class="c8">Studies using these mice have advanced our knowledge quite considerably. We now have good reason to speculate that, just as the macroscopic world we live in influences us, we are also influenced by the microscopic world that lives in us. This is all the more interesting when we realize that each person’s inner world is unique to him or her.</p>
