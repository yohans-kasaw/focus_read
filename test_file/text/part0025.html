<p class="c6"><img src="../images/00004.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="c7"><strong class="calibre6">W</strong><small class="calibre7">E ALWAYS WANT</small> to protect ourselves from harm. Few people would choose to have <em class="calibre8">Salmonellae</em> or a nasty <em class="calibre8">H. pylori</em>. Even though we have not yet identified them all, we know already that we’d rather not have chubby bacteria or microbes that cause diabetes or depression. Our greatest protection against them is cleanliness. We are careful about eating raw food, kissing strangers, and washing our hands to rid them of anything that might spread disease. But cleanliness is not always what we imagine it to be.</p>
<p class="c8">Cleanliness in our gut is something akin to cleanliness in a forest. Even the most conscientious of cleaners would not dream of taking a mop to the forest floor. A wood is clean if the beneficial plants it contains are in healthy equilibrium. We can help the forest along by sowing seeds and hoping new plants will take root. We can identify favorite or useful plants in the forest and nurture them to help them grow and multiply. Sometimes, there are nasty pests. Then, careful consideration is in order. If the situation is desperate, chemicals might be the answer. As their name implies, pesticides are great at killing pests, but it is not a great idea to spray them round like air freshener.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_224" class="calibre2"></a>Clever cleanliness begins with our everyday routines—but what is well-advised caution and what is excessive hygiene? There are three main tools for keeping our insides clean. Antibiotics can rid us of acute pathogens, while prebiotic and probiotic products can promote beneficial elements. <em class="calibre8">Pro bios</em> means “for life.” Probiotics are edible living bacteria that can make us healthier. <em class="calibre8">Pre bios</em> means “before life.” Prebiotics are foodstuffs that pass undigested into the large intestine, where they feed our beneficial bacteria so that they thrive better than bad bacteria. <em class="calibre8">Anti bios</em> means “against life.” Antibiotics kill bacteria and are our saviors when we have picked up a pack of bad bacteria.</p>
<p class="c14"><span class="c15"><strong class="calibre4">Everyday Cleanliness</strong></span></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">THE FASCINATING THING</small> about cleanliness is that it is mostly in the head. A peppermint tastes fresh, clean windows look clear, and we love slipping into a freshly made bed after a hot shower. We like the smell of clean things. We like to run our hands over smooth, polished surfaces. We find comfort in the idea that we are protected from an invisible world of germs if we use enough disinfectant.</p>
<p class="c8">In Europe 130 years ago, it was discovered that tuberculosis is caused by bacteria. This was the first time the public took notice of bacteria—and they were seen as bad, dangerous, and, most worryingly, invisible. It was not long before new regulations were introduced in European countries: patients were isolated so they could not spread their germs; spitting was forbidden in schools; close physical contact was discouraged; and warnings were issued against “the communism of the towel!” People were even advised to limit kissing to “the erotically unavoidable.” That might sound funny to us today, but those ideas put down deep roots that can still be felt in our modern Western <a id="page_225" class="calibre2"></a>society: spitting is still frowned upon, we are still reluctant to share towels and toothbrushes, and we keep a greater physical distance in our dealings with others than most cultures.</p>
<p class="c8">Preventing deadly disease by banning pupils from spitting at school seemed like a simple and effective idea. We internalized it in our culture as a social rule. Those who did not comply were despised as a danger to everyone’s health. This attitude was passed on from parent to child, and public spitting became a social taboo. Cleanliness really was thought to be next (in importance) to godliness; people craved a sense of order in a life full of chaos. The anthropologist Mary Douglas summed this up in her book <em class="calibre8">Purity and Danger</em> with the phrase, “Dirt is matter out of place.”</p>
<p class="c8">Bathing as a way of keeping the body clean was a privilege of the rich even up to the beginning of the twentieth century. It was around that time that dermatologists in Germany began to call for “a bath a week for every German!” Large companies built bathhouses for their employees and encouraged personal hygiene by issuing them with free towels and soap. The tradition of the weekly bath did not really take hold until the 1950s. Then, typical families took their bath on a Saturday evening, one after another in the same bathwater, and hard-working Dad often got to go in the tub first. Originally, personal cleanliness meant ridding the body of unpleasant smells and visible dirt. As time went on, this concept became increasingly abstract. It’s hard for us today to imagine this once-a-week family bathing routine. We spend money on disinfectants to get rid of things we can’t even see. The surface in question looks exactly the same after cleaning as it did before—yet just knowing it is clean is extremely important to us.</p>
<p class="c8">The news media tell us horror stories about dangerous flu viruses, multi-drug-resistant superbugs, and EHEC-contaminated food. When food contamination scares such as tainted salad recalls are in the news, some people react by giving up <a id="page_226" class="calibre2"></a>lettuce while others type “full body decontamination shower” into Google. Different people deal with fear in different ways. Dismissing this as hysteria is too easy. It makes more sense to try and understand where these fears come from.</p>
<p class="c8">Fear-driven hygiene involves attempting to clean everything away or kill it off. We don’t know what it might be, but we assume the worst. When we clean obsessively, we do indeed get rid of everything—both bad and good. This cannot be a good kind of cleanliness. The higher the hygiene standards in a country, the higher that nation’s incidence of allergies and autoimmune diseases. The more sterile a household is, the more its members will suffer from allergies and autoimmune diseases. Thirty years ago, about one person in ten had an allergy. Today that figure is one in three. At the same time, the number of infections has not fallen significantly. This is not smart hygiene. Research into Nature’s huge range of bacteria has led to a new understanding of what cleanliness should mean. It is no longer defined as the attempt to kill off potential dangers.</p>
<p class="c8">More than 95 percent of the world’s bacteria are harmless to humans. Many are extremely beneficial. Disinfectants have no place in a normal household. They are appropriate only if a family member is sick or the dog poops on the carpet. If a sick dog poops on the carpet, there are no holds barred—bring on the steam cleaners, disinfectant by the bucket-load, or a small flame thrower, perhaps. That might even be fun! But if the floor is just covered in dirty footprints, water and a drop of cleaning fluid are all you need. That combination is already enough to reduce the bacteria population of your floor by 90 percent, and it leaves the normal, healthy population of the floor a chance to recolonize the territory. What remains of any harmful elements is so little as to be negligible.</p>
<p class="c8">The aim of cleaning, then, should be to reduce bacteria numbers—but not to zero. Even harmful bacteria can be good for us when the immune system uses them for training. A couple of <a id="page_227" class="calibre2"></a>thousand <em class="calibre8">Salmonella</em> bacteria in the kitchen sink are a chance for our immune system to do a little sightseeing. They become dangerous only when they turn up in greater numbers. Bacteria get out of hand when they encounter the perfect conditions: a protected location that is warm and moist with a supply of delicious food. There are four recommended strategies for keeping them in check: dilution, temperature change, drying, and cleaning.</p>
<p class="c22">Dilution</p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">DILUTION IS A</small> technique we also use in the laboratory. We dilute bacteria with fluids and administer drops with different concentrations of bacteria to wax moth larvae, for example. Wax moth larvae change color when they get sick. That makes them a good indicator of the concentration of bacteria required to cause illness. For some, it’s a little as a thousand per drop of fluid, for others, as many as ten million.</p>
<p class="c8">One example of bacteria dilution in the home is washing fruit and vegetables. Washing dilutes most soil-dwelling bacteria to such a low concentration that they become harmless to humans. Koreans add a little vinegar to the water to make it slightly acidic and just that bit more uncomfortable for any bacteria. Airing a room is also a dilution technique.</p>
<p class="c8">If you dilute the bacteria on your plates, cutlery, and cutting board nicely with water, then wipe them over with a kitchen sponge before putting them away, you may as well have licked them clean with your tongue. Kitchen sponges offer the perfect home for any passing microbe—nice and warm, moist, and full of food. Anyone looking at a kitchen sponge under the microscope for the first time usually wants to curl up on the floor in a fetal position, rocking back and forth in disgust.</p>
<p class="c8">Kitchen sponges should only be used for cleaning the worst of the dirt off. Plates, cutlery, and so on should then be rinsed briefly under running water. The same is true for dish towels <a id="page_228" class="calibre2"></a>or drying-up cloths if they never get a chance to dry out. They are more useful for spreading a nice even layer of bacteria on your utensils than for drying them. Sponges and cloths should be thoroughly wrung out and allowed to dry—otherwise they become the perfect place for moisture-loving microbes.</p>
<p class="c22">Drying</p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">BACTERIA CANNOT BREED</small> on dry surfaces. Some cannot survive there at all. A freshly mopped floor is at its cleanest after it has dried. Armpits that are kept dry by antiperspirants are less cozy homes for bacteria—and fewer bacteria produce less body odor. Drying is a great thing. If we dry food it keeps for longer before it rots. We use this to our advantage: just think of foodstuffs like pasta, muesli, crisp bread, dried fruit (such as raisins), beans, lentils, and dried meats.</p>
<p class="c22">Temperature</p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">IN MANY PARTS</small> of the world, the environment is refrigerated naturally once a year. From a bacteriological point of view, winter is the real spring clean! Refrigerating food is an extremely important part of our daily lives, but a fridge contains so much food that it remains a paradise for bacteria even at low temperatures. The optimum temperature for your fridge is something below 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius).</p>
<p class="c8">Let’s move on to another household appliance—the washing machine. Most washing machine programs use the dilution principle to clean our clothes and that is sufficient. However, damp kitchen cloths, a load of underpants, or sick people’s laundry should be washed at 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) or more. Most <em class="calibre8">E. coli</em> bacteria are killed by temperatures above 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), and 158 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) is enough to kill off tougher <em class="calibre8">Salmonella</em> bacteria.</p>
<p class="c22"><a id="page_229" class="calibre1"></a>Cleaning</p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">CLEANING MEANS REMOVING</small> a film of fats and proteins from surfaces. Any bacteria living in it or under it will be removed along with the film. We usually use water and cleaning fluid to achieve this. Cleaning is the technique of choice for all living spaces, kitchens, and bathrooms.</p>
<p class="c8">This technique can be taken to the absolute extreme. That is sensible when you are manufacturing medical drugs that are destined to be pumped straight into a patient’s veins (such as infusions). The drugs need to be absolutely free of all bacteria. This is achieved in pharmacological laboratories by using iodine, for example. Iodine sublimates, which means it transitions from a solid, crystalline state to a gaseous vapor in the presence of heat without passing through a liquid phase. So pharmacologists heat up iodine until the entire production lab is veiled in a blue vapor.</p>
<p class="c8">It sounds like the simple principle of the steam cleaner, but there is more to it than that. Iodine can also desublimate. To make this happen, the room is cooled and the vapor immediately recrystallizes. Millions of tiny crystals form on all surfaces and even in mid-air, trapping every microbe as they do so, locking them up in a crystal prison as they fall to the ground. Workers pass through several airlocks and disinfection chambers, dress up in germ-free bodysuits, and sweep up the iodine crystals.</p>
<p class="c8">In principle, we use the same system when we use hand cream. We trap microbes in a film of fat and hold them captive there. When we wash the film off, we rinse the bacteria away with it. Since our skin produces a natural coating of fat, soap and water are often enough to achieve this effect. Some of the fat layer remains, aiding its replenishment after washing. Too frequent hand washing makes no sense—and the same is true of too frequent showering. If the protective fat layer is rinsed away too often, our unprotected skin is exposed to the environment.</p>

<p class="c18"><em class="calibre8">Bacteria trapped in iodine crystals.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="c7"><a id="page_231" class="calibre2"></a>That gives odor-producing bacteria a better foothold, making us smell more pungently than before, creating a vici ous circle.</p>
<p class="c22">New Methods</p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">A TEAM FROM</small> Ghent in Belgium is currently trying out a brand-new method. The researchers are attempting to use bacteria to combat body odor. They disinfect volunteers’ armpits, spread them with odorless bacteria, and start the stopwatch. After a couple of minutes, the subjects are allowed to put their shirts back on and go home. The volunteers return repeatedly to the laboratory, where experts sniff their armpits. The initial results are quite promising—the odorless bacteria manage to banish their smelly colleagues in many of the subjects’ armpits.</p>
<p class="c8">Not far away, across the border in Germany, the same method is in use in the public toilets of the small town of Düren. A company is using a mixture of bacteria to clean the toilets. The odorless bacteria occupy the places normally colonized by the bugs that create that all-too-familiar public toilet smell. The idea of using bacteria to clean public conveniences is a brilliant one. Unfortunately, the company refuses to reveal the recipe for its cocktail of bacterial cleaners, so a scientific evaluation is impossible. However, the town of Düren seems to be faring very well with this experiment.</p>
<p class="c8">These new ideas about the use of bacteria illustrate one thing very clearly: cleaning does not mean annihilating all bacteria. Cleanliness is a healthy balance of sufficient good bacteria and a few bad ones. That means smart protection against real dangers and, sometimes, deliberate contamination with good bugs. With this in mind, we can perhaps better appreciate the wisdom of observations like that of the American writer <a id="page_232" class="calibre2"></a>Suellen Hoy, who says in her book <em class="calibre8">Chasing Dirt</em>, “From the perspective of a middle-class American woman (also a seasoned traveler) who has weighed the evidence, it is certainly better to be clean than dirty.”</p>
<p class="c14"><span class="c15"><strong class="calibre4">Antibiotics</strong></span></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">ANTIBIOTICS ARE RELIABLE</small> killers of dangerous pathogens. And their families. And their friends. And their acquaintances. And distant acquaintances of their acquaintances. That makes them the best weapon against dangerous bacteria—and the most dangerous weapon against good bacteria. But who is it who manufactures most antibiotics? It’s bacteria. Huh?</p>
<p class="c8">Antibiotics are the weapons used by both sides in the war between fungi and bacteria.</p>
<p class="c8">Ever since researchers discovered all this, pharmaceutical companies have been intensively farming bacteria. Huge tanks with a capacity of up to 26,500 US gallons (100,000 liters) are used to grow so many bacteria that their numbers can hardly be expressed in any meaningful figures. They produce antibiotics, which we purify and press into little tablets. The product sells well, especially in the United States. When researchers were planning a study of the effect of antibiotics on the flora of the gut, they were able to find only two people in the entire San Francisco Bay Area who had not taken antibiotics in the previous two years. In Germany, one person in every four takes antibiotics once a year on average. The main reason for taking them is colds. This is like a knife in the heart of any microbiologist. Colds are often not even caused by bacteria, but by viruses! Antibiotics can work in three different ways: by peppering the bacteria with holes, by poisoning the bacteria, or by rendering the bacteria unable to reproduce. They have no effect on viruses at all.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_233" class="calibre2"></a>So taking antibiotics to cure a cold is usually a complete waste of time. If they do bring about an improvement, this is due either to the placebo effect or to the work of the immune system in combating the cold virus. The senseless use of antibiotics does, however, kill many helpful bacteria, which can be harmful in itself. To avoid this, doctors can perform a procalcitonin test, which indicates whether cold-like symptoms are caused by a bacterial or viral infection. The test can be especially helpful to make sure children don’t take antibiotics unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="c8">There is no reason not to take antibiotics when it is medically appropriate to do so. The benefits certainly outweigh the disadvantages, for example, in cases of severe pneumonia or for helping children get over a particularly bad infection with no long-term damage. In such cases, those little tablets can save lives. Antibiotics stop bacteria from reproducing, the immune system kills off any remaining pathogens, and we soon start to feel better. We have to pay a price for this, but in the final reckoning, it’s a good deal.</p>
<p class="c8">The most common side effect is diarrhea. Even those who don’t get diarrhea may notice that they leave a rather larger deposit in the morning toilet bowl than usual. To tell it like it is: a large portion of that pile is dead gut bacteria. The antibiotic tablet does not travel directly from mouth to blocked-up nose. It descends into the stomach and then on to the gut. Before it graduates from there into the bloodstream—and then to the nose, among other places—it peppers our microbe collection with holes, poisons our gut bacteria, and makes them sterile. The result is a formidable battlefield—you can see the casualties the next time you go to the toilet.</p>
<p class="c8">Antibiotics can alter our gut flora significantly. Our microbe collection becomes much less diverse and the abilities of the bacteria in it can change. Changes include the amount of <a id="page_234" class="calibre2"></a>cholesterol they can absorb, their ability to produce vitamins (like skin-friendly vitamin H), and the type of foodstuffs they can help us digest. Preliminary studies carried out at Harvard and in New York have shown that the two antibiotics metronidazole and gentamicin cause particularly hefty changes in the flora of the gut.</p>
<p class="c8">Antibiotics can be problematic for children and old people. Their gut flora is already less stable and less able to recover after treatment with antibiotics. Research in Sweden showed that the gut bacteria of children were still significantly altered two months after taking antibiotics. Their guts contained more potentially harmful bacteria and fewer beneficial types like <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacteria</em> and <em class="calibre8">Lactobacilli.</em> The antibiotics used were ampicillin and gentamicin. The study involved only nine children, which means it is not particularly meaningful in scientific <a id="page_235" class="calibre2"></a>terms, but it remains the only study of its kind so far. So the results should be accepted with a degree of caution.</p>
<p class="c16"><img src="../images/00045.jpeg" class="width" alt=""/></p>
<p class="c8">A more recent study of pensioners in Ireland revealed a clear dichotomy. Some gut landscapes recovered very well after a course of antibiotics, while others remained permanently altered. The reasons for this are still completely unclear. The ability to return quickly to a stable state following an extreme experience is described with same word by gut researchers and psychologists: resilience.</p>
<p class="c8">Even though antibiotics have been in use for more than fifty years, studies of the long-term effects can still be counted almost on one hand. The reason for this is technological: the equipment necessary for such investigations has only been around for a couple of years. The only long-term effect that has been scientifically proven is drug resistance. For as long as two years after taking antibiotics, bad bacteria are still present in the gut, telling their great-great-great- . . . -grandchildren stories about the war.</p>
<p class="c8">These are the ones that resisted the antibiotics and survived. And with good reason. Bacteria develop resistance strategies. Some install tiny pumps in their cell walls to pump the antibiotic out like emergency workers pumping water out of a flooded cellar. Others prefer to disguise themselves so the antibiotics cannot recognize their surface and so cannot pepper them with holes. Yet others use their ability to split things—they build tools to cut the antibiotics to pieces.</p>
<p class="c8">The thing is that antibiotics rarely kill all bacteria. They kill certain communities depending on the toxins they use. There will always be some bacteria that survive and become experienced fighters. In the case of serious illness, these fighters can become a problem. The more resistances the bacteria have developed, the more difficult it is to get them under control again with antibiotics.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_236" class="calibre2"></a>Every year, many thousands of people die because they are infected with bacteria that have developed resistances that no drug can counter. When their immune system is compromised—for example, after an operation—or if the resistant bacteria have got out of hand after a long course of treatment with antibiotics, the patient can be in real danger. Very few new drugs are in development, for the simple reason that it is not very profitable for pharmaceutical companies to do so.</p>
<p class="c30">SO HERE ARE four pieces of advice for anyone who wants to keep out of unnecessary antibiotic gut wars.</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">1.</span>Do not take antibiotics unless it is really necessary. And if you do have to take them, then always complete the course. This is because resistance fighters who are less skilled will eventually give up the cause and succumb to the drug. So the only ones that remain are those that would never have been killed by the antibiotics anyway. But at least the rest will have been well and truly done in.</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">2.</span>Choose organically farmed meat. Drug resistances differ from country to country. It is shocking to see how often these resistances correspond to the antibiotics used in large-scale animal farming. In countries like India or Spain, for example, there is almost no regulation of the amount of antibiotics given to animals. This turns the animals’ guts into giant breeding zoos for resistant bacteria. And people in such regions have significantly more infections with multi-drug-resistant strains. In other countries, regulations do exist, but even here the rules are ridiculously vague. This allows many vets to make a lot of money in the semi-legal antibiotics trade.</p>
<p class="c35">It was not until 2006 that the European Union banned the use of antibiotics in animal feed as performance enhancers. The kind of performance being enhanced here is <a id="page_237" class="calibre2"></a>the ability of an animal to not die of infections in a crowded and dirty pen. Antibiotics are a great way to “enhance” this “performance.” In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration is working on a voluntary plan to phase out the use of some of these antibiotics in regular farming. In organic farming, the Department of Agriculture forbids the use of any antibiotics, and an animal given antibiotics—for example, to relieve suffering—must be removed from organic production.</p>
<p class="c35">If possible, it is worth spending that little extra—to prevent resistance-breeding zoos and for your peace of mind . . . and peace of gut. The dividends are not immediate, but it is an investment in a better future for us all.</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">3.</span>Wash fruit and vegetables thoroughly. Animal feces are a popular fertilizer, and liquid manure is used in vegetable fields. In many countries, fruit and vegetables are not routinely tested for residues of antibiotics—and certainly not for multi-drug-resistant gut bacteria. Milk, eggs, and meat are usually tested to make sure they don’t exceed certain limits. So err on the side of caution and wash your fruit and vegetables one extra time if you are not sure. Even tiny amounts of antibiotics can help bacteria develop resistances.</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">4.</span>Take care abroad. One traveler in four returns home carrying highly resistant bacteria. Most disappear in a few months, but some lurk around for much longer. Special care should be taken in bacterial problem countries like India. In Asia and the Middle East, you should wash your hands regularly, and clean fruit and vegetables thoroughly—if necessary with boiled water. Southern Europe also has its problems. “Cook it, peel it, or leave it” is not only a good rule for avoiding diarrhea, it also protects against unwanted resistant souvenirs for you and your family.</p>
<p class="c22"><a id="page_238" class="calibre1"></a>Are There Alternatives to Antibiotics?</p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">PLANTS PRODUCE ANTIBIOTICS</small> that have functioned for centuries without causing resistances. (Fungi, such as the penicillin fungus, are not plants but opisthokonts, like animals.) When parts of plants snap off or become perforated, they need to produce antimicrobial substances at the location of the damage. If they did not do this, they would immediately become a feast for any bacteria in the vicinity. Pharmacies sell concentrated plant antibiotics to treat developing cold symptoms, urinary infections, and inflammations in the mouth and throat. Some products contain mustard seed or radish seed oil, for example, or chamomile and sage extract. Some can reduce the numbers of viruses as well as bacteria. That leaves our immune system with less to contend with, giving it a better chance of dealing with pathogens.</p>
<p class="c8">Such plant-based remedies are not the solution for serious illnesses or for illnesses that drag on with no noticeable improvement. In such cases, they can even be harmful because they encourage us to wait too long before turning to powerful antibiotics. In recent years, the incidence of heart and ear damage in children has increased. This is often due to the behavior of parents who want to protect their children from too much exposure to antibiotics. Such a decision can have damaging consequences. A well-informed doctor will not prescribe antibiotics for every little thing—but will tell you in no uncertain terms when they are really necessary.</p>
<p class="c8">Our relationship with antibiotics is an arms race: we use them to arm ourselves to the hilt when faced with dangerous bacteria, and they respond by arming themselves with even more dangerous resistances. Medical researchers should really be developing the next generation of weapons in this race. Every one of us accepts a trade-off when we take these drugs. We agree to sacrifice our good bacteria in the hope of getting rid <a id="page_239" class="calibre2"></a>of the bad. In the case of a minor cold, that’s not a good deal; for serious illnesses, it’s a trade that pays off.</p>
<p class="c8">There is no species protection program for gut bacteria. We can be pretty certain that we have annihilated many family heirlooms since the discovery of antibiotics. The places they leave vacant should be colonized by the best candidates possible—probiotics, for example. They help the gut to return to a state of healthy equilibrium after danger has been averted.</p>
<p class="c14"><span class="c15"><strong class="calibre4">Probiotics</strong></span></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">WE SWALLOW MANY</small> billions of living bacteria every day. They are on raw food, a few survive on cooked food, we nibble on our fingers without even thinking about it, we swallow our own mouth bacteria or kiss our way through the bacterial landscapes of others. A small proportion even survive the acid bath of the stomach and the aggressive digestive process to reach our large intestine alive.</p>
<p class="c8">No one knows the majority of these bacteria. They presumably do us no harm, or perhaps even benefit us in some way we have not yet discovered. A few are pathogens, but they usually cannot harm us because their numbers are just too small. Only a fraction of these bacteria have been thoroughly checked out by scientists and given the official seal of approval. These bacteria can proudly call themselves probiotics.</p>
<p class="c8">We often read the word “probiotic” on the yogurt we find on our supermarket shelves without having any real idea what it means or how they work. Most will recall television commercials telling us they strengthen our immune system, or showing us a constipated aunt relieved of her woes and recommending this brand to everyone she knows. That all sounds good. You don’t mind spending a little extra for a healthy <a id="page_240" class="calibre2"></a>product like that. And before you know it, those probiotics are in your shopping basket, then in your fridge, and eventually in your mouth.</p>
<p class="c8">People have been eating probiotic bacteria since time immemorial. Without them, we would not exist. A group of South Americans had to learn that through bitter experience. They had the clever idea of taking pregnant women to the South Pole to have their babies. The plan was that the babies born there could stake a claim to any oil future reserves as natives of the region. The babies did not survive. They died soon after birth or on the way back to South America. The South Pole is so cold and germ-free that the infants simply did not get the bacteria they needed to survive. The normal temperatures and bacteria the babies encountered after leaving the Antarctic were enough to kill them.</p>
<p class="c8">Helpful bacteria are an important part of our life, and we are constantly surrounded and covered by them. Our ancestors had no idea of their existence, but they intuitively did the right thing: protecting their food from the bacteria that make it rot by handing it over to the care of good bacteria. In other words, they used bacteria to preserve their food. Every culture in the world includes traditional dishes that rely on the help of microbes for their preparation. Germany has its sauerkraut, pickled gherkins, and sourdough pretzels; the French love their crème fraîche; the Swiss have their hole-riddled cheese; salami and preserved olives come from Italy; Turks swear by a salty yogurt drink called ayran. None of these delicacies would exist if it weren’t for microbes.</p>
<p class="c8">There are many, many examples from Asian cuisine: soy sauce, kombucha drinks, miso soup, Korean kimchi. Indians have lassi and Africans have fufu . . . the list is endless. All these foods rely on bacteria for a process we call fermentation. The process often results in the production of acid, which makes the yogurt or vegetables taste sour. This acid, along with the many <a id="page_241" class="calibre2"></a>good bacteria, protects the food from dangerous microbes. Fermentation is the oldest and healthiest way of preserving food.</p>
<p class="c8">The bacteria used in this technique were as varied around the world as the foods they helped to produce. The soured milk drunk in rural Germany was made using different bacteria from those used to make the ayran enjoyed in Anatolia. In the warmer countries of the south, bacteria were used that prefer to work under higher temperature conditions; in the chilly north, bacteria were chosen that like to do their job at room temperature.</p>
<p class="c8">Yogurt, soured milk, and other fermented products came about by accident. Someone left the milk outside, bacteria found their way into the churn (either directly from the cow or from the air during milking), the milk thickened, and a new kind of food had been invented. If a particularly delicious yogurt bacteria jumped into the mix, people added a spoonful of that yogurt to the next batch to make more of the same. Unlike today’s yogurt products, however, traditional types were the work of whole teams of different bacteria—not just selected individual species.</p>
<p class="c8">The diversity of bacteria in fermented foods has fallen sharply. Industrialization has resulted in standardized production processes using single bacteria species isolated in laboratories. Today, milk is briefly heated soon after it leaves the udder to kill off any potential pathogens, but this also kills any potential yogurt bacteria. That’s why you can’t just leave modern shop-bought milk to go sour in the hope that it will eventually turn into yogurt.</p>
<p class="c8">Many foods that used to be full of bacteria are now preserved using vinegar, as is the case with most pickled gherkins today. Some things are fermented using bacteria but then heated to kill off the microbes—shop-bought sauerkraut, for instance. Fresh sauerkraut is usually only sold in specialist health-food stores these days.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_242" class="calibre2"></a>Scientists in the early twentieth century suspected that good bacteria were of great benefit to us. That is when Ilya Metchnikoff appeared on the yogurt scene. The Nobel Prize winner spent his time observing Bulgarian mountain peasants. He realized they often lived to be a hundred years old or more, and they were unusually contented. Metchnikoff suspected the key to their longevity lay in the leather bags they used to transport the milk from their cows. The peasants had to walk long distances, and their milk often turned sour or transformed into yogurt in the bags before they reached home. Metchnikoff became convinced that the secret to their long lives was their regular consumption of this bacterial product. In his book <em class="calibre8">The Prolongation of Life,</em> he asserted the claim that good bacteria can help us live longer, better lives. From then on, bacteria were no longer just anonymous components of yogurt, but important promoters of health. However, Metchnikoff’s timing could hardly have been worse. Shortly before, it had been discovered that bacteria cause disease. Although the microbiologist Stamen Grigorov identified the bacterium described by Metchnikoff as <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus bulgaricus</em> in 1905, he soon turned his efforts to the fight against tuberculosis. The successful use of antibiotics in fighting disease from around 1940 meant that the idea was fixed in most people’s minds: the fewer bacteria, the better.</p>
<p class="c8">We have babies to thank for the fact that Ilya Metchnikoff’s idea and Grigorov’s <em class="calibre8">bacillus</em> eventually found their way onto our supermarket shelves. Mothers who were unable to breast-feed their babies found they often had a problem with their bottle-fed offspring. The babies were getting diarrhea much more often than they should. This took the formula-milk industry by surprise, because they had taken care to make sure their product contained the same substances as real breast milk. What could be missing? The answer was, of course, bacteria. And, specifically, the bacteria that live on milky nipples and which are <a id="page_243" class="calibre2"></a>particularly common in the guts of breast-fed babies: <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacteria</em> and <em class="calibre8">Lactobacilli.</em> These bacteria break down the sugar in milk (lactose) and produce lactic acid (lactate), so they are classified as lactic-acid bacteria. A Japanese scientist used <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus casei</em> Shirota to create a special yogurt, which mothers could initially buy only in pharmacies. When they fed it to their babies every day, the infants contracted diarrhea much less frequently. Industrial food research returned to Metchnikoff’s idea—with baby bacteria and more modest aims.</p>
<p class="c8">Most normal yogurt contains <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus bulgaricus</em>, although it is not necessarily precisely the same sort as that in the yogurt of the Bulgarian peasants. Today, the species discovered by Stamen Grigorov is more correctly known as <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus helveticus</em> spp. <em class="calibre8">bulgaricus</em>. These bacteria are not particularly good at resisting digestion and only a small number of them reach the large intestine alive. That is not so important for some effects on the immune system—often just the sight of a few empty bits of bacteria wall is enough to prompt our immune cells into action.</p>
<p class="c8">Probiotic yogurt contains bacteria that researchers were inspired to use by the case of the bottle-fed babies with diarrhea. They are meant to reach the large intestine alive. Examples of bacteria that can resist being digested are <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em>, <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus acidophilus</em>, and the abovementioned <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus casei</em> Shirota. The theory is that a living bacterium will have a greater effect on the gut. There are studies that show their effects, but they are not sufficient to satisfy the European Food Safety Authority. It has banned companies like Yakult and Danone from claiming their products promote health in their advertising.</p>
<p class="c8">These doubts are compounded by the fact that it is not always possible to know whether enough probiotic bacteria are reaching the large intestine alive. A break in the cold chain, or <a id="page_244" class="calibre2"></a>a person with a particularly acidic stomach or slow digestion, might kill off these microbes before they reach their intended destination. That is not harmful, of course, but it means consuming a probiotic yogurt may have no effect that a normal yogurt doesn’t also have. To make any difference to the huge ecosystem in our gut, about a billion (109) bacteria need to make it through the system and arrive there intact.</p>
<p class="c8">To summarize: any yogurt can be good for you, although not everyone can tolerate milk protein or too much animal fat. The good news is that there is a world of probiotics beyond yogurt. Researchers are busy in their laboratories examining selected bacteria. They dribble bacteria directly onto gut cells in petri dishes, feed mice with microbial cocktails, or get volunteers to swallow capsules full of living microorganisms. Probiotic research has roughly defined three areas in which our good bacteria can display fascinating abilities.</p>
<p class="c22">1. Massaging and Pampering</p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">MANY PROBIOTIC BACTERIA</small> take good care of our gut. They possess genes that enable them to produce small fatty acids like butyrate. This soothes and pampers the villi in the gut. Pampered villi are much more stable and likely to grow bigger than unpampered ones. The bigger the villi grow, the better they are at absorbing nutrients, minerals, and vitamins. The more stable they are, the less rubbish they let through. The result is that our body receives more nutrients and fewer damaging substances.</p>
<p class="c22">2. Security Service</p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">GOOD BACTERIA DEFEND</small> our gut—it is, after all, their home and they do not willingly surrender their territory to bad bacteria. Sometimes they defend the gut by occupying the very places pathogens like to infect us most. When a bad bacterium turns up, it finds them sitting in its favorite spot with <a id="page_246" class="calibre2"></a>satisfied grins on their faces and their handbags on the seats next to them, leaving no room for anyone else to take up residence. Should that signal not be explicit enough—no problem! Security service bacteria have more tricks up their sleeves. For example, they can produce small amounts of antibiotics or other defensive substances that drive unfamiliar bacteria out of their immediate vicinity. Or they use various acids, which not only protect yogurt and sauerkraut from rotting bacteria, but also make our gut a less inviting environment for bad bacteria. Another trick is to snatch the bad bacteria’s food away (anyone with siblings may be familiar with this strategy). Some probiotic bacteria seem to have the ability to steal bad bacteria’s food from right under their noses. Eventually, the bad guys have had enough and give up.</p>
<p class="c9"><a id="page_245" class="calibre1"></a><img src="../images/00046.jpeg" class="width" alt=""/></p>
<p class="c22">3. Good Advice and Training</p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">AND, LAST</small> <small class="calibre7">BUT</small> not least, the best experts in all things bacterial are bacteria themselves. When they work together with our gut and its immune cells, they provide us with insider information and useful advice. What do the different bacteria’s outer walls look like? How much protective mucus is needed? What quantity of bacterial defense substances (defensins) should the gut cells produce? Does the immune system need to be more active in its reaction to foreign substances or should it sit back and accept newcomers?</p>
<p class="c8">A healthy gut contains many probiotic bacteria. We benefit every day and every second from their abilities. But sometimes our bacterial community faces attack. That can be from antibiotics, a bad diet, illness, stress, and many, many other causes. Our guts are then less well cared for, less protective, and less good at giving advice. When that is the case, we can be thankful that some of the results of laboratory research have made it onto pharmacy shelves. Living bacteria are available that can be <a id="page_247" class="calibre2"></a>used like temporary workers brought in to help during times of heavy workloads.</p>
<p class="c8"><em class="calibre8">Good for treating diarrhea.</em> This is the number-one use for probiotics. Gastroenteritis (stomach flu) and diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics can be helped using various pharmacy-bought bacteria. They can reduce the length of such a bout of diarrhea by about a day. At the same time, unlike most diarrhea medications, they are almost free of side effects. That means they are particularly suitable for small children and old people. In conditions like ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome, probiotics can increase the intervals between diarrhea attacks or inflammatory flare-ups.</p>
<p class="c8"><em class="calibre8">Good for the immune system</em>. For people who tend to get sick often, it can be a good idea to try different probiotics, especially when colds are rife. If that is too expensive, eating a pot of yogurt a day may be enough, since bacteria don’t necessary have to be alive to trigger some mild effects. Studies have shown that old people and high-performance athletes, in particular, are less prone to catching colds if they take probiotics regularly.</p>
<p class="c8"><em class="calibre8">Possible protection against allergies</em>. This is not as well documented as the effect of probiotics on diarrhea or a compromised immune system. Still, probiotics are a good option for parents of children with an increased risk of developing allergies or neurodermatitis. A large number of studies show they can offer significant protection. In some studies, the effect could not be proven, but that may be because each study used a different kind of bacterium. Personally, I think the “better safe than sorry” approach is appropriate here. Probiotics certainly do no harm to children with a high risk of developing allergies. Some studies showed an improvement in the symptoms of those already suffering from allergies or neurodermatitis.</p>
<p class="c8">As well as the well-researched areas like diarrhea, gastrointestinal disease, and the immune system, there are other <a id="page_248" class="calibre2"></a>areas that are only now undergoing scientific scrutiny. Digestive complaints, traveler’s diarrhea, lactose intolerance, obesity, inflammatory joint disease, and diabetes are all promising areas of research.</p>
<p class="c8">If you ask your pharmacist to recommend a probiotic product to help with one of these problems (for example, constipation or flatulence), she will not be able to give you one that has been scientifically proven to work. The pharmaceutical industry and academic research are equally behind in this area. What remains for you is to try out different products for yourself until you hit upon a bacterium that seems to help. The packaging should always include the name of the bacteria the product contains. Try it for about four weeks and if you see no improvement, give a different bacterium a go. Some gastroenterologists will advise you about the kind of bacteria that are more likely to be the ones you are looking for.</p>
<p class="c8">The rules are the same for all probiotics. You should try them for about four weeks and make sure they are still within the best-before date (otherwise sufficient bacteria may not have survived to have any effect on the huge ecosystem of the gut). Before buying probiotic products, you should find out whether they are intended by the manufacturer for the complaint you are hoping to treat. Different bacteria have different genes—some are better at advising the immune system, others are more belligerent about ridding the gut of diarrhea-causing bugs, and so on.</p>
<p class="c8">The best-researched probiotics to date are lactic-acid bacteria (<em class="calibre8">Lactobacilli</em> and <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacteria</em>) and <em class="calibre8">Saccharomyces boulardii</em>, which is a yeast. This yeast has not received the attention it deserves. It is not a bacterium, so it is not one of my favorites either, but it does have one huge advantage: as a yeast, it has absolutely nothing to fear from antibiotics.</p>
<p class="c8">So, while we are massacring our entire bacteria population by taking antibiotics, <em class="calibre8">Saccharomyces</em> can move in and set up <a id="page_249" class="calibre2"></a>house without a worry in the world. It can then protect the gut from harmful opportunists. It also has the ability to bind toxins. However, it does cause more side effects than bacterial probiotics. For example, some people have an intolerance to yeasts, which can cause them to break out in a rash.</p>
<p class="c8">The fact that almost all the probiotics we know—give or take a yeast or two—are lactic-acid bacteria shows how little we have yet discovered in this area. <em class="calibre8">Lactobacilli</em> are normally less common residents in the guts of adults, and <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacteria</em> are unlikely to be the only health-promoting microbes present in the large intestine. At the time of writing, there is only one other probiotic bacteria species that is as well researched as the two mentioned above: <em class="calibre8">E. coli</em> Nissle 1917.</p>
<p class="c8">This strain of <em class="calibre8">E. coli</em> was first isolated from the feces of a soldier returning from the Balkan War. All the soldier’s comrades had suffered severe diarrhea in the Balkans, but he had not. Since then, many studies have been carried out to show that this bacterium can help with diarrhea, gastrointestinal disease, and a compromised immune system. Although the soldier died many years ago, scientists continue to breed his talented <em class="calibre8">E. coli</em> in medical laboratories and package it up for sale in pharmacies so it can work its wonders in other people’s guts.</p>
<p class="c8">There is one limitation to the efficacy of all current probiotics we take: they are isolated species of bacteria bred in the lab. As soon as we stop taking them, they mostly disappear from our gut. Every gut is different and contains regular teams that help each other or wage war on each other. When somebody new turns up, they are at the back of the line when it comes to allocating places. So, currently, probiotics work like hair conditioner for the gut. When you stop taking them, the regular flora folk have to continue their work. To achieve longer-lasting results, researchers are now looking at the possibilities of a mixed-team strategy: taking several bacteria together, so that they can help each other to gain a foothold in unknown <a id="page_250" class="calibre2"></a>territory. They clear away each other’s waste and produce food for their colleagues.</p>
<p class="c8">Some products you can buy at the pharmacy, drugstore, or supermarket already use this strategy, with a mix of our trusty old lactic-acid friends. And it seems they really do work better as a team. The idea that we might be able to encourage these bacteria to settle permanently in our gut is a nice one, but it has not yet been seen to work well . . . to put it mildly.</p>
<p class="c8">But if you persist doggedly with the teamwork strategy, it can have impressive results, for example, in treating <em class="calibre8">Clostridium difficile</em> infections. <em class="calibre8">Clostridium difficile</em> is a bacterium that can survive treatment with antibiotics and then colonize the entire area left free by the bacteria killed by treatment. Infected people often have bloody, slimy diarrhea for many years, which does not respond to further treatment with antibiotics or probiotics. This can put great strain not only on the body, but also on the mind.</p>
<p class="c8">In difficult situations like this, doctors really have to use all their creativity. A few brave medics have now begun transplanting experienced teams of bacteria, including all possible good and true gut bacteria, from the guts of healthy donors to those with <em class="calibre8">Clostridium difficile</em> infections. Luckily, such a transplant is relatively easy to carry out (it has been used for decades by veterinary practitioners to cure many diseases). All you need are some healthy feces, complete with bacteria, and that’s it. The treatment is known as fecal bacteriotherapy, or more directly, a fecal transplant. The feces used in medical fecal transplants are not pure, but they are purified. Then, it does not really matter whether they enter through the front or back door, so to speak.</p>
<p class="c8">Almost all studies show a success rate of around 90 percent in treating previously incurable diarrhea caused by <em class="calibre8">Clostridium difficile</em>. Few medical drugs have such a high success rate. Despite these positive results, the treatment can currently be used only on patients with truly hopeless cases of incurable <a id="page_251" class="calibre2"></a>diarrhea. The danger is that other diseases or potentially harmful bacteria might be transplanted along with the donor stool. Some companies are already working to develop artificial stool that they can guarantee is free of any harmful elements. If they succeed, the therapy is likely to become much more widespread.</p>
<p class="c8">Probiotics’ greatest potential probably lies in transplanting beneficial bacteria to the gut, where they would settle permanently and grow. Such transplants have already helped patients with severe diabetes. Scientists are currently investigating whether they can also be used to prevent patients from ever developing full-blown type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p class="c8">The connection between stool and diabetes may not be immediately obvious to everyone. But, in fact, it is not as absurd as it seems. It is not just defensive bacteria that are transplanted with the stool, but an entire microbial organ that plays an important part in regulating the body’s metabolism and immune system. We are still completely ignorant of more than 60 percent of these gut bacteria. Looking for species that may have probiotic effects is time-consuming and difficult, just as the search for medicinal plants was in the past. Only this time, the search is going on inside us. Every day we live and every meal we eat influence the great microbial organ inside us—for better or for worse.</p>
<p class="c14"><span class="c15"><strong class="calibre4">Prebiotics</strong></span></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">THE CENTRAL IDEA</small> surrounding the use of prebiotics is to support our good bacteria by eating certain foods. Prebiotics are much more suitable for daily use than probiotics. To gain the benefits they offer, just one condition must be met: good bacteria must already be present in the gut. These can then be encouraged by eating prebiotic food, which gives the good bacteria more power over any bad bacteria that may also be present.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_252" class="calibre2"></a>Since bacteria are so much smaller than we are, they view food from a very different perspective from our own. Every little grain becomes a major event, a comet of deliciousness. Food we cannot digest in the small intestine is called dietary fiber or roughage. But, despite the name, it is not rough on the bacteria of the large intestine. Quite the opposite, in fact: they love it! Not all kinds, but some, anyway. Some bacteria love undigested asparagus fibers, while others prefer undigested meat fibers.</p>
<p class="c8">Some doctors who recommend their patients eat more dietary fiber do not even really know the reason, which is that they are prescribing a hearty meal for your bacteria that will benefit you, too. Finally your gut microbes get enough to eat, so they can produce vitamins and healthy fatty acids or put the immune system through a good training session. However, there are always some pathogens among the bacteria in our gut. They can use certain foodstuffs to produce substances like indole, phenols, or ammonia. Those are the substances you find in the chemistry cupboard with a warning symbol on the bottle.</p>
<p class="c8">This is exactly how prebiotics can help: they are roughage that can only be eaten by nice bacteria. If such a food were available in the human world, the lunch room at work would be quite an eye-opener! Household sugar is not a prebiotic, for example, because it is also a favorite of tooth-decay bacteria. Bad bacteria cannot process prebiotics at all, or hardly, and so they cannot use prebiotics to produce their evil chemicals. At the same time, good bacteria fed with prebiotics grow constantly in power and can gain the upper hand in the gut.</p>
<p class="c8">And it is not even very hard to do yourself and your best microbes a favor with prebiotics. Most people already have a <a id="page_254" class="calibre2"></a>favorite prebiotic dish that they would not mind eating more often. My granny always has some potato salad in her fridge, my dad’s specialty is a great endive salad with mandarin segments (here’s a tip: rinse endive leaves briefly under warm water—this leaves them crispy but removes some of the bitterness), and my sister can’t resist asparagus or black salsify in a creamy sauce.</p>
<div class="c17">
<p class="c9"><a id="page_253" class="calibre1"></a><img src="../images/00047.jpeg" class="width1" alt=""/></p>
<p class="c18"><em class="calibre8">Artichoke, asparagus, endive, green bananas, Jerusalem artichoke, garlic, onion, parsnips, black salsify, wheat (wholegrain), rye, oats, leek.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="c8">Those are just a few dishes that <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacteria</em> and <em class="calibre8">Lactobacilli</em> love to eat. We now know that they prefer vegetables from the lily family (<em class="calibre8">Liliaceae</em>), which includes leeks and asparagus, onions, and garlic. They also like <em class="calibre8">Compositae</em> plants, which are those from the sunflower family, including endives, salsify, artichokes, and Jerusalem artichokes. Resistant starches are also on their list of favorites.</p>
<p class="c8">Resistant starches form, for example, when potatoes or rice are boiled and then left to cool. This allows the starches to crystalize, making them more resistant to digestion. This means that more of your potato salad or cold sushi rice reaches your microbes untouched. If you don’t already have a favorite prebiotic dish, give them a try. Eating these dishes regularly has an interesting side effect—it causes regular cravings for just such foods.</p>
<p class="c8">People who eat mainly low-fiber foods like pasta, white bread, or pizza should not suddenly switch to eating large portions of high-fiber foods. That will only overwhelm their underfed bacterial community. The sudden change will freak the bacteria out, and they will metabolize everything they can in a fit of euphoria. The result is a never-ending trumpet concerto from down below. So, the best strategy is to gradually increase the amount of dietary fiber and not to feed your bacteria with massive, unmanageable amounts. After all, the food we eat is still first and foremost for us, and only secondarily for the inhabitants of our large intestine.</p>
<p class="c8">Overproduction of gas is not a pleasant thing—it bloats the gut, making us feel uncomfortable—but passing a bit of <a id="page_255" class="calibre2"></a>wind is not only necessary, it is healthy, too. We are living creatures with a miniature world living inside us, working away and producing many things. Just as we release exhaust fumes into the Earth’s atmosphere, so must our microbes, too. It may make a funny sound and it may smell a bit, but not necessarily. <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacteria</em> and <em class="calibre8">Lactobacilli,</em> for instance, do not produce any unpleasant odors. People who never need to break wind are starving their gut bacteria and are not good hosts for their microbe guests.</p>
<p class="c8">Pure prebiotics can be bought at the pharmacy or drugstore. These include the prebiotic inulin, which is extracted from endives, and GOS (galacto-oligosaccharides), which are isolated from milk. These substances have been tested for their health-giving effects and are pretty efficient at feeding only certain <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacteria</em> and <em class="calibre8">Lactobacilli.</em></p>
<p class="c8">Prebiotics are nowhere near as well researched as probiotics, although there are already some sound results pertaining to how they work. Prebiotics promote good bacteria, resulting in a reduction in the amount of toxins produced in the gut. People with liver problems, especially, are unable to detoxify these substances well, and that can cause serious problems. Bacterial toxins have various effects on the body, including anything from fatigue and tremors to comas. When such patients are treated in hospital, they are often given highly concentrated prebiotics, which usually leads to a disappearance of their symptoms.</p>
<p class="c8">But bacterial toxins also influence Joe Blow with his fully functioning liver. Toxins can develop, for example, if Joe eats too little dietary fiber and the fiber is all used up at the beginning of his large intestine. The bacteria at the end of his gut will then pounce on any undigested proteins. Bacteria and meat can be a bad combination—we know it’s never a good idea to eat rotten meat. Too many meat toxins can damage the large intestine and, in a worst-case scenario, can even cause cancer. The end of <a id="page_256" class="calibre2"></a>the gut is more prone to cancers on average than the rest of the organ. That’s why researchers are so keen to test how well prebiotics can protect against cancer. Early results are promising.</p>
<p class="c8">Prebiotics like GOS are interesting because they are also produced by our own bodies. Ninety percent of the roughage in human breast milk is GOS, and the remaining 10 percent is made up of other indigestible fiber. In cow’s milk, GOS accounts for only 10 percent of the fiber content. So it appears there is something about GOS that is important for human babies. If bottle-fed babies are given formula milk that contains a little GOS powder, their gut bacteria looks similar to that of breastfed babies. Some studies indicate that they are less prone to allergies and neurodermatitis in later life than other bottle-fed babies. GOS has been approved as an additive to infant milk formula for a few years, but it is not obligatory.</p>
<p class="c8">Since then, interest in GOS has increased, and another of its effects has now been demonstrated in the laboratory. GOS docks onto gut cells directly—preferably at locations otherwise favored by pathogens. That means these prebiotics act as microscopic shields. Bad bacteria cannot get a good hold and are more likely to slip and fall away. These results have prompted new studies into GOS as a way of preventing traveler’s diarrhea.</p>
<p class="c8">More research has been carried out into inulin than GOS. Inulin is sometimes used as a sugar or fat substitute in the food industry because it is a little bit sweet and has a gel-like consistency. Most prebiotics are sugars that are linked into chains. When we speak of sugar, we often mean a particular molecule extracted from sugar beet or sugar cane, but there are more than a hundred different kinds of sugar. If, historically, we had developed a sugar industry based on endive sugar, our sweets would not cause tooth decay. Sweetness is not in itself unhealthy, we simply eat only the most unhealthy kind of sweetness.</p>
<p class="c8">We are often skeptical about products that are labeled sugar-free or low fat. Sweeteners like aspartame appear to be carcino<a id="page_257" class="calibre2"></a>genic, and other substances used in typical diet products are also used in factory farming to fatten pigs. So our skepticism is justified. But a product that contains inulin as a sugar or fat substitute may well be healthier than one with a full dose of animal fat or sugar. It is worth reading the label on diet products closely because we can consume some of them with a clean conscience and our gut microbes will thank us for it, too.</p>
<p class="c8">Inulin cannot bind with our cells as well as GOS. A large and well-run study in the United Kingdom showed it did not offer any protection against traveler’s diarrhea, although the test subjects did report a general improvement in well-being after taking inulin. This pleasant effect was not reported by members of the control group, who were given a placebo. Inulin can be produced with different chain lengths, which is great for attaining a beneficial distribution of good bacteria. Short inulin chains are eaten by the bacteria at the start of the large intestine and longer chains are consumed closer to the end.</p>
<p class="c8">The so-called ITF<sub class="calibre12">MIX</sub> containing chains of differing lengths has good results, where more surface area equals better results, for example in the absorption of calcium, which requires bacteria to pass it through the gut wall. In one experiment, ITF<sub class="calibre12">MIX</sub> was seen to improve calcium absorption in young girls by up to 20 percent. That is good for the bones and can help protect against osteoporosis in old age.</p>
<p class="c8">Calcium is such a good example because it shows the limits of what can be achieved with prebiotics. Firstly, you have to ingest enough calcium for an effect to kick in, and secondly, prebiotics can do nothing if the problem lies with other organs. When many women go through menopause, their bones get weaker. This is due to a mid-life crisis in the ovaries. They have to say goodbye to their life of producing hormones and learn how to enjoy their retirement. But the bones miss those hormones! No prebiotic in the world can help with this kind of osteoporosis.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_258" class="calibre2"></a>Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the power of prebiotics. Almost nothing influences our gut bacteria as much as the food we eat. Prebiotics are the most powerful tool at our disposal if we want to support our good bacteria—that is, those that are already there and are there to stay. Prebiotic creatures of habit, like my potato salad–addicted granny, are doing the best part of their microbial organ a favor without even knowing it. Incidentally, her second favorite vegetable is leeks. Whenever everyone else was ill, she would be there with a big smile and some soup, merrily playing us a few songs on the piano. I don’t know if her defenses had anything to do her microbes, but it’s not an illogical conclusion.</p>
<p class="c8">So, we should remember: good bacteria do us good. We should feed them well so they can populate as much of our large intestine as possible. Pasta and bread made of white flour on factory production lines are not enough. We need to include real roughage, made of real dietary fiber in vegetables and fruit. This roughage can also satisfy a sweet tooth and taste delicious. It can be fresh asparagus, sushi rice, or pure, isolated prebiotics from the pharmacy. Our bacteria will like it, and they will thank us with their good services.</p>
<p class="c30"><small class="calibre7">SEEN UNDER THE</small> microscope, bacteria look like nothing but little, bright spots against a dark background. But taken together, their sum is much greater than their parts. Each one of us hosts an entire population. Most sit in our mucus membrane, diligently training our immune system, soothing our villi, eating what we don’t need, and producing vitamins for us. Others keep close to the cells of the gut, needling them or producing toxins. If the good and the bad are in equilibrium, the bad ones can make us stronger and the good ones can take care of us and keep us healthy.</p>
