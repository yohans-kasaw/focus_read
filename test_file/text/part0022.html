<p class="c6"><img src="../images/00004.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="c7"><strong class="calibre6">I</strong><small class="calibre7">N TERMS OF</small> our microbiota, we reach adulthood around the age of three. For a gut, being an adult means knowing how you work and what you like. When that stage has been reached, some gut microbes find themselves on a great expedition with us through our entire lives. We dictate the itinerary—by eating what we eat, reacting to stress, going through puberty, getting ill, and growing old.</p>
<p class="c8">Those people who post pictures of their dinner on Facebook, only to be disappointed by the lack of “likes” from friends, are simply trying to appeal to the wrong audience. If there were such a thing as Facebug (Facebook for microbes!), a picture of your dinner would provoke an excited response from millions of users—and shudders of disgust from millions more. The menu changes daily: useful milk digesters contained in a cheese sandwich, armies of <em class="calibre8">Salmonella</em> bacteria hiding in a delicious dish of tiramisu. Sometimes we alter our gut flora, and sometimes it alters us. We are our flora’s weather and its seasons. Our flora can take care of us, or it can poison us.</p>
<p class="c8">We are only now beginning to learn the impact the gut-based bacterial community can have on an adult human. In this respect, scientists know more about bees than about human <a id="page_168" class="calibre2"></a>beings. For bees, having more diverse gut bacteria has been a more successful evolutionary strategy. They were only able to evolve from their carnivorous wasp ancestors because they picked up new kinds of gut microbes that were able to extract energy from plant pollen. That allowed bees to become vegetarians. Beneficial bacteria provide bees with an insurance policy in times of food scarcity: they have no trouble digesting unfamiliar nectar from far-flung fields. More specialized digesters are not so well equipped. Times of crisis highlight the advantage of hosting a good microbial army. Bees with well-equipped gut flora can deal with parasite attacks better than those without. Gut bacteria are an incredibly important factor in this evolutionary survival strategy.</p>
<p class="c8">Unfortunately, we cannot simply transfer these results to humans. Humans are not bees; they are vertebrates and they use Facebook. So researchers have to go back to square one. Scientists investigating our gut bacteria have to learn to understand an almost completely unknown world and its interaction with the world outside. First, they need to know who is living inside our gut.</p>
<p class="c8">So let’s take a closer look. Who exactly are these characters?</p>
<p class="c8">Biologists love to put things in order—from the contents of their own desks to the entire contents of the world. They begin by sorting everything into two large drawers: one for living things and the other for non-living things. They then go on to divide everything in the first drawer into three categories: eukaryotes, Archaea, and bacteria. Representatives of all three groups can be found in the gut. I am not promising too much when I say each of the three groups has its own kind of charm.</p>
<p class="c8">Eukaryotes are made up of the largest and most complex cells. They can be multicellular and grow to a pretty impressive size. A whale is a eukaryote. Humans are eukaryotes. Ants are too, incidentally, although they are much smaller than we <a id="page_169" class="calibre2"></a>are. Modern biologists divide eukaryotes into six subgroups: crawly amoeboid microbes, microbes with pseudopodia (foot-like protrusions that aren’t real feet), plant-like organisms, single-celled organisms with little mouth-like feeding grooves, algae, and opisthokonts.</p>
<p class="c8">For those unfamiliar with the term <em class="calibre8">opisthokont</em> (it comes from the Greek words for “rear” and “pole”), it describes the group that includes all animals—humans as well—and also fungi. So, the next time you meet an ant in the street you can give it a friendly wave as a fellow opisthokont. The most common eukaryotes found in the gut are yeasts, which are also opisthokonts. We are familiar with yeast as a rising agent for bread, but there are many other kinds.</p>
<p class="c8">Archaea are kind of in-betweeners. Not really eukaryotes, but not really bacteria, either. Their cells are small and complex. If this description seems a little vague, it may help if I say that the Archaea are pretty rad characters. They love the extreme things in life. Some are hyperthermophiles, which feel right at home in temperatures of more than 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) and are often to be found hanging out near volcanoes. The acidophiles among the Archaea like to paddle around in highly concentrated acid. Barophiles (also called piezophiles) thrive under pressure and have specially adapted cell walls to allow them to live on the deep sea floor. Halophiles are at home in extremely salty water (they love the Dead Sea). The rare characters among the Archaea that can be cultured in the lab are the cryophiles, which love the cold. They like laboratory freezers that keep them at a cozy minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 80 degrees Celsius). There is one species of Archaea often found in our gut that thrives on the waste products of other gut bacteria and can glow.</p>
<p class="c8">Returning to the main topic: bacteria make up more than 90 percent of the population of our gut. Biologists divide bacteria <a id="page_170" class="calibre2"></a>into more than twenty phyla or lineages. Members of different phyla are sometimes about as similar as human beings are to excavates (single-cell microbes with feeding grooves)—that is to say, not very. Most of the inhabitants of our gut belong to one of five phyla: mainly Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, with a smattering of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. These phyla are further divided into increasingly specific categories, until we eventually reach the level of the bacteria family. Members of a given family are relatively similar to each other. They eat the same food, keep similar company, and have similar abilities. Individual family members have impressive names like <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides uniformis</em>, <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus acidophilus</em>, or <em class="calibre8">Helicobacter pylori</em>. The bacteria kingdom is huge.</p>
<p class="c8">Whenever scientists search humans for a particular bacterium, they constantly come across new, previously unknown species. Or they discover known species in unexpected places. In 2011, a group of researchers in the United States decided to examine the flora of volunteers’ belly buttons, just for fun. One subject’s navel was found to contain bacteria that were previously known to live only in the seas off the coast of Japan—despite the fact that the volunteer had never even been to Asia. Globalization is not just your local corner shop turning into a McDonald’s—it affects even the contents of our navels. Every day, billions and billions of foreign microorganisms fly round the world without paying a single cent for their tickets.</p>
<p class="c8">Everyone has their own personal collection of bacteria. It could even be described as a unique bacterial fingerprint. If you were to take swabs from a dog and analyze the genes of its bacteria, the dog’s owner could be easily identified with reasonable <a id="page_172" class="calibre2"></a>certainty. The same is true of computer keyboards. Anything we come into regular contact with carries our microbial signature. Everyone has some outlandish items in their collection that almost no one else will share.</p>
<div class="c17">
<p class="c9"><a id="page_171" class="calibre1"></a><img src="../images/00040.jpeg" class="width1" alt=""/></p>
<p class="c18"><em class="calibre8">Rough overview of the three most important phyla of bacteria and their subgroups.</em> Lactobacilli <em class="calibre8">are Firmicutes, for example.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="c8">The microbial landscape in our gut is just as unique and individual. So, how are doctors supposed to know what is beneficial and what is harmful? Uniqueness like this presents researchers with a problem. If they are trying to ascertain what influence our gut bacteria have on our health, it is no use finding out that Mr. Smith is carrying a strange Asian species and several other weird microbes in his gut. Scientists need to identify patterns to deduce facts from them.</p>
<p class="c8">So, since scientists are faced with more than a thousand different families of bacteria, they must decide whether they need to identify just rough lineages or whether they should look at every paid-up member of the <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em> bacteria family individually. <em class="calibre8">E. coli</em> and its evil twin <small class="calibre7">EHEC</small> are members of the same family, for example. The differences between them are infinitesimally small—but they are very tangible: <em class="calibre8">E. coli</em> is a harmless gut-dweller, while <small class="calibre7">EHEC</small> causes severe internal bleeding and diarrhea. It always makes sense to examine families or lineages when you want to know what damage individual bacteria can wreak.</p>
<p class="c14"><span class="c15"><strong class="calibre4">The Genes of Our Bacteria</strong></span></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">GENES ARE POSSIBILITIES.</small> Genes are information. Genes can be dominant, forcing features on us, or they can just offer their abilities for us to use or not. But most of all, genes are plans. They are incapable of doing anything unless they are read and implemented. Implementation of some of these plans is obligatory—they decide whether we are a human being or a bacterium, for example. Others (say, liver spots) can be left on <a id="page_173" class="calibre2"></a>the back burner for years and yet others might be carried for a lifetime without ever being expressed—for example, genes for large breasts. Some people might consider that a pity, others a blessing.</p>
<p class="c8">Taken together, our gut bacteria have 150 times more genes than a human being. This massive collection of genes is called a biome. If we could pick 150 different living things, parts of whose genetic blueprints we would like to possess, what would we choose? Some people might opt for the strength of a lion, the wings of a bird, the hearing of a bat, or the practical mobile home of a snail.</p>
<p class="c8">There are many reasons why it would be more practical to opt for bacterial genes instead. They can be taken in easily via the mouth, unfurl their abilities in the gut, and even adapt to our lifestyle. Nobody needs a snail’s mobile home all the time, and no one needs breast-milk-digestion helpers forever. The latter disappear gradually after weaning. It is not yet possible to examine all the genes of our gut bacteria at once. However, it is possible to search specifically for individual genes, if you know what you are looking for. We know that babies contain more active genes for digesting breast milk than adults do. The guts of obese people are often found to contain more bacterial genes involved in breaking down carbohydrates. Older people have fewer bacterial genes for dealing with stress. In Tokyo, gut bacteria can help digest seaweed, and in Toronto, they probably can’t. Our gut bacteria paint a rough portrait of who we are: young, chubby, or Asian, perhaps.</p>
<p class="c8">The genes of our gut bacteria also inform us about our body’s abilities. The pain-relief drug acetaminophen can be more toxic for some people than others: some gut bacteria produce a substance that influences the liver’s ability to detoxify the drug. Whether you can pop a pill to cure your headache without a second thought is decided partially in your gut.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_174" class="calibre2"></a>Similar caution should be exercised with general dietary tips. Soy’s ability to protect against prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, or bone disorders, for example, has now been proven. More than 50 percent of Asians benefit from this effect. Among people of European heritage, the beneficial effect is found among only 25 to 30 percent of the population. This cannot simply be explained by human genetic differences. The difference is due to certain bacteria. They are found more commonly in the guts of Asians, where they are able to coax the health-promoting essence out of tofu and other soy products.</p>
<p class="c8">It is great for science when it identifies the individual bacterial genes that are responsible for this beneficial effect. In such cases, science can be said to have come up with an answer to the question of how gut bacteria influence our health. But we want more than that. We want to understand the big picture. If you look at all the bacterial genes so far discovered, the small individual groups of genes responsible for breaking down painkillers or soy products fade into the background. The common features they share dominate the picture. Every microbe contains many genes involved in breaking down carbohydrates or proteins and in producing vitamins.</p>
<p class="c8">Science has the same problem when investigating the microbiome that the Google generation regularly faces. We ask a question and six million sources send us simultaneous answers. We don’t respond by telling them to form an orderly line. We have to sort them shrewdly into categories, weed out the irrelevant ones, and recognize important patterns. One important step in this direction was the discovery of the three human enterotypes in 2011.</p>
<p class="c8">Researchers in Heidelberg, Germany, were using cutting-edge technology to investigate the human gut biome. They expected to see the usual picture: a chaotic mixture of many different bacteria, including a host of unknown species. What <a id="page_175" class="calibre2"></a>they actually discovered came as a surprise. Despite the great diversity, there was order. One of three families was always dominant in the realm of bacteria. Suddenly, the whole mess of more than a thousand families looked much more organized.</p>
<p class="c14"><span class="c15"><strong class="calibre4">The Three Gut Types</strong></span></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">A PERSON’S ENTEROTYPE</small> depends on the family of bacteria that dominates the microbe population of their gut. The choice is between families that bask in the glory of the names <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em>, <em class="calibre8">Prevotella,</em> and <em class="calibre8">Ruminococcus.</em> Researchers identified these enterotypes distributed among Asians, Americans, and Europeans, irrespective of age or gender. In the future, enterotyping may help doctors predict a whole range of characteristics, such as the body’s response to soy, nerve resilience, or susceptibility to certain diseases.</p>
<p class="c8">Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine who were visiting the institute in Heidelberg at the time of this discovery recognized an opportunity to combine their ancient knowledge with modern medicine. Classical Chinese medical theory has always divided people into three groups according to how they react to certain medicinal plants, such as ginger. The families of bacteria in our bodies also have different characteristics. They break down food in different ways, produce different substances, and detoxify certain toxins but not others. Furthermore, they may also influence the gut flora by either encouraging or attacking bacteria from the other two groups.</p>
<p class="c22"><em class="calibre11">Bacteroides</em></p>
<p class="c7"><em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em> <small class="calibre7">ARE THE</small> best-known family of gut bacteria and often form the dominant population. They are experts in breaking down carbohydrates, and they possess a huge collection <a id="page_176" class="calibre2"></a>of genetic blueprints, which allows them to manufacture any enzyme they need to accomplish that task. Whether we eat a steak, munch a large salad, or chew on a raffia doormat in a drunken stupor, <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em> know straight away which enzymes they need. They are equipped to extract energy from whatever we ingest.</p>
<p class="c8">Their ability to extract the maximum energy from everything and pass it on to us has led to the suspicion that they may be responsible for an increased tendency to gain weight. Indeed, <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em> do seem to like meat and saturated fatty acids. They are more common in the guts of people who eat plenty of sausages and the like. But, does having them in our gut make us fat, or does being fat lead to having them in our gut? This question remains to be answered. <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em> carriers are also likely to have a weakness for their colleagues, <em class="calibre8">Parabacteroides.</em> These bacteria are also particularly deft at passing on as many calories to us as possible.</p>
<p class="c8">This enterotype is also notable, among other things, for its ability to produce particularly large amounts of biotin. Other terms for biotin include vitamin B7 and vitamin H. It was given the name vitamin H in the 1930s because of its ability to heal a certain skin condition caused by consuming too much raw egg white. “H is for healing” might not be the most creative mnemonic, but it is a useful one nonetheless.</p>
<p class="c8">Vitamin H neutralizes avidin, a toxin found in raw eggs. It causes the skin disease in question by binding strongly with vitamin H, leaving the body deficient in that substance. So, eating raw eggs causes vitamin H deficiency, which in turn can lead to skin disease.</p>
<p class="c8">I do not know who was eating enough raw eggs in the 1930s to lead to the discovery of this connection. I do, however, know who might possibly end up eating so much avidin in the future that they could have problems with vitamin H—pigs <a id="page_177" class="calibre2"></a>who accidently roam into a field of genetically modified corn. Genetic engineers have created transgenic corn with a gene that produces avidin to make it less susceptible to insect damage during storage. When pests—or stray pigs—consume the corn, they are poisoned. When the corn is cooked, it is no longer toxic, just like a good hard-boiled egg.</p>
<p class="c8">Another indication that our gut microbes produce vitamin H is the fact that some people excrete more of it than they take in. Since no human cell is capable of producing this substance, the only possible explanation for this is that our bacteria are functioning as hidden vitamin H factories. Vitamin H is not only necessary for “healthy-looking skin, shiny hair, and strong nails,” as you might read on the packages of supplements you can buy in your local pharmacy. Biotin is also involved in some of the body’s vital metabolic processes. We need it to synthesize carbohydrates and fats for our body, and to break down proteins.</p>
<p class="c8">Skin, hair, and nail problems are not the only effects of biotin deficiency. It can also cause depression, lethargy, susceptibility to infections, neurological disorders, and increased cholesterol levels in the blood. However, let me issue a serious WARNING here: the list of symptoms caused by any vitamin deficiency is formidable. Most people reading them feel the symptoms apply to them in some way. But it is important to remember that you can catch a cold or feel a bit lethargic without jumping to the conclusion that you have a biotin deficiency. And cholesterol levels are more likely to be raised by eating a big plate of bacon for breakfast than by eating the avidin in an undercooked egg.</p>
<p class="c8">However, some people in higher-risk groups may well consider the possibility of a biotin deficiency. That includes anyone who takes antibiotics for an extended period, heavy drinkers, anyone who has had part of their small intestine removed, anyone reliant on dialysis, and people on certain kinds of <a id="page_178" class="calibre2"></a>medication. These people require more biotin than they can get from a normal diet. One healthy higher-risk group is pregnant women: developing babies use up biotin like aging refrigerators gobble up electricity.</p>
<p class="c8">So far, no scientific studies have been carried out to investigate how much biotin our gut bacteria provide us with. We know that they produce some, and that antibacterial medications such as antibiotics can cause biotin deficiency. Investigating whether members of the <em class="calibre8">Prevotella</em> enterotype are more likely to suffer from a biotin deficiency than someone of the <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em> enterotype would be a pretty exciting research project. But, since the existence of the three different enterotypes was only discovered in 2011, there are many more pressing questions we need to answer.</p>
<p class="c8">It is not only their good output that makes <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em> so successful; they also work hand in hand with others. Some species in the gut make a living by clearing away the waste left by <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides.</em> This is a win-win situation: <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em> work better in tidy surroundings, and the waste-disposal organisms have a secure source of income. On a different level, we find the composters. These organisms not only utilize waste products for their own ends, they also use them to make products that <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em> can use in turn. For some metabolic pathways, <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em> themselves take on the role of composter. For example, if they need a carbon atom to modify a molecule, they simply reach up and grab it out of the atmosphere in the gut. They always find what they are looking for, since carbon is a waste product of our metabolism.</p>
<p class="c22"><em class="calibre11">Prevotella</em></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">IN MANY WAYS,</small> the <em class="calibre8">Prevotella</em> family is the opposite of <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides.</em> Studies have shown that they are more common in the guts of vegetarians, but they also appear in moderate meat <a id="page_179" class="calibre2"></a>eaters and in convinced carnivores. Our diet is not the only factor that influences the colonization of our gut. But more about that presently.</p>
<p class="c8"><em class="calibre8">Prevotella</em> also have a group of bacterial colleagues they prefer working with—<em class="calibre8">Desulfovibrionales</em>. <em class="calibre8">Desulfovibrionales</em> often have a long flagellum—a whiplike tail used to propel them along—and so, like <em class="calibre8">Prevotella</em>, they are adept at trawling through our mucus membranes looking for useful proteins. They then either eat those proteins or use them to build who-knows-what. <em class="calibre8">Prevotella</em> produce sulfur compounds when they work. The smell of these compounds is familiar, as we know it from boiled eggs. If it weren’t for <em class="calibre8">Desulfovibrionales</em> whipping around with their propeller-tails, snapping up the sulfur, <em class="calibre8">Prevotella</em> would soon find themselves drowning in a sulfur swamp of their own making. Incidentally, this gas is not dangerous to human health. Our nose wrinkles at it as a precautionary measure as it can slowly become toxic as concentrations increase a thousandfold.</p>
<p class="c8">Another substance that contains sulfur and has an interesting smell is the vitamin associated with this enterotype: thiamine. Also known as vitamin B1, this is one of the most widely recognized and important vitamins. Our brains require it not only to keep the nerves well nourished, but also to coat them in an electrically insulating layer of fat. This explains why a thiamine deficiency may be the cause of muscle tremors and forgetfulness.</p>
<p class="c8">A very serious lack of vitamin B1 causes a disease called beriberi. It was described in Asia as early as AD 500. Beriberi means “I cannot, I cannot” in the Sinhalese language of Sri Lanka and refers to the fact that sufferers have difficulty walking due to nerve damage and muscle atrophy. It is now known that polishing rice removes the vitamin B1 it contains, and a diet made up predominantly of this kind of rice leads to an onset of symptoms within a few weeks.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_180" class="calibre2"></a>While not resulting in serious neurological or memory disorders, a less severe vitamin B1 deficiency can cause irritability, frequent headaches, and lack of concentration. More advanced cases can cause a susceptibility to edema and heart problems. But once again, beware: these symptoms can have many causes. They are only a reason for concern when they are unusually frequent or severe. They are rarely caused exclusively by a vitamin deficiency.</p>
<p class="c8">Studying the symptoms of vitamin deficiencies provides a useful insight into the part played by vitamins in certain processes. Anyone whose diet does not consist exclusively of polished white rice or alcohol is usually well supplied. The fact that our gut bacteria help supply us with essential vitamins means they are far more than just a load of flagellating sulfur-poopers—and that is what makes them so fascinating.</p>
<p class="c22"><em class="calibre11">Ruminococcus</em></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">OPINIONS ARE DIVIDED</small> on this family—scientific opinions, at any rate. Some scientists who decided to investigate the existence of enterotypes for themselves found <em class="calibre8">Prevotella</em> and <em class="calibre8">Bacteroides</em>, but no <em class="calibre8">Ruminococcus</em> group. Others swear this third group exists, and yet others insist there is even a fourth or fifth group, or more. Such a state of affairs can really ruin the coffee break at a medical congress.</p>
<p class="c8">Let’s agree for the sake of argument that there is at least a possibility that this group exists. Its proposed favorite food is the cell walls of plants. Possible colleagues include <em class="calibre8">Akkermansia</em> bacteria, which break down the mucins in mucus and absorb sugar pretty quickly. <em class="calibre8">Ruminococcus</em> produces a substance called haem, which the body needs for many things, including producing blood.</p>
<p class="c8">One character who probably had problems producing haem was Count Dracula. A genetic defect has been identified in his <a id="page_181" class="calibre2"></a>home country, Romania, that results in symptoms that include a lack of tolerance to garlic, sensitivity to sunlight, and the production of red urine. This urine discoloration is caused by a defect in blood production that means sufferers excrete the unfinished precursors of blood production. Nowadays, those affected by the condition—called porphyria—are given medical treatment rather than the starring role in a horror story.</p>
<p class="c8">Even if the <em class="calibre8">Ruminococcus</em> enterotype does not exist, there is no doubt that these bacteria are present in our gut. So, it is useful that we now know more about them—and about Dracula and red pee. Our bacteria-free laboratory mice have trouble forming haem, and so it stands to reason that bacteria are somehow important in this process.</p>
<p class="c8">Now we are more familiar with the tiny world of the microbes in our gut. Their genes represent a huge pool of borrowed abilities. They help us digest our food, and they produce vitamins and other useful substances. We are just beginning to recognize enterotype commonalities and search for patterns. And we do this for one reason: 100 trillion tiny creatures reside in our gut and that cannot but have an effect on us. So, let’s now go one step further and explore the palpable effects they have on us. Let’s take a closer look at how these gut bacteria affect our metabolism, and examine which ones do us good and which ones do us harm.</p>
