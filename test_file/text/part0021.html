<p class="c7"><strong class="calibre6">A</strong><small class="calibre7">S UNBORN BABIES,</small> we live in an environment that is normally completely germ-free—the womb. For nine months, we have no contact with the outside world except through our mother. Our food is predigested, our oxygen is prebreathed. Our mother’s lungs and gut filter everything before it reaches us. We eat and breathe through her blood, which is kept free of germs by her immune system. We are sheathed in an amniotic sac and encased in a muscly uterus that is corked with a thick plug like a big earthenware jug. All this means not a single parasite, virus, bacterium, or fungus—and certainly no other person—can touch us. We are more sterile than an operating table flooded with disinfectant.</p>
<p class="c8">This situation is unusual. Never again in our lives will we be so protected and so isolated. If we were designed to remain germ-free once we leave the womb, we would be very different creatures. But that is not the case, so all living things of any size have at least one other living thing that helps them in some way and is allowed to live on or in them in return. This explains why our cells are constructed in such a way that bacteria can easily dock with structures on their surface, and it explains why certain bacteria have coevolved with us over many millennia.</p>
<p class="c9"><a id="page_160" class="calibre1"></a><img src="../images/00039.jpeg" class="width1" alt=""/></p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_161" class="calibre2"></a>As soon as there is any breach in the protective amniotic sac, colonization begins. While 100 percent of the cells that make us up when we start life are human cells, we are soon colonized by so many microorganisms that only 10 percent of our cells are human, with microbes accounting for the remaining 90 percent. We cannot see this, because our human cells are so much larger than those of our new lodgers. Before we look into our mother’s eyes for the first time, the creatures that live in her body cavities have already looked into ours. The first ones we meet are her protective vaginal flora—an army that defends a very important territory. One way it does this is by producing acids that drive away other bacteria and keep the way cleaner and cleaner the closer they are to the womb.</p>
<p class="c8">Unlike the flora in our nostrils, which can be made up of around nine hundred different kinds of bacteria, the criteria for life in the birth canal are much stricter. This sorting process leaves women with a useful coating of bacteria, which wraps itself protectively around the sterile body of the baby as it emerges. About half these bacteria are from one genus: <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus.</em> Their favorite pastime is producing lactic acid. This means the only residents that can set up home in the birth canal are those that pass the acid test.</p>
<p class="c8">With a routine birth, all we have to do as babies is decide which way to face as we come out. There are two attractive possibilities: toward the back or toward the front. During birth we are exposed to all sorts of skin contact before we are wrapped up in something soft by another person, who is usually wearing latex gloves.</p>
<p class="c8">By now, the founding fathers of our first microbial colonies are already in us and on us. These are mainly our mother’s vaginal and gut flora, mixed with a few skin-dwelling germs and possibly a few others from the hospital’s repertoire. This is a very good mixture to start with. The acid army protects us from <a id="page_162" class="calibre2"></a>harmful invaders, while other bacteria are already starting to train the immune system, and the first, indigestible components of our mother’s milk are broken down for us by helpful microbes.</p>
<p class="c8">Some of these bacteria take less than twenty minutes to spawn the next generation. What takes us twenty years or more happens in a fraction of the time—a fraction as tiny as the colonists themselves. While our first gut bacterium watches its great-great-great-great grandchild swim by, we have spent just two hours in the arms of our proud new parents.</p>
<p class="c8">Despite this rapid population growth, it will be about three years before the gut flora develops to the right level and then stabilizes. Prior to that, our gut is the scene of dramatic power struggles and great bacterial battles. Some folks who find their way into our mouth spread rapidly throughout the gut, only to disappear again just as quickly. Others will remain with us for the rest of our lives. The composition of our gut colony depends partly on our own actions: we might lick our mother’s skin, gnaw on a chair leg, and give the car window or the neighbor’s dog the occasional sloppy kiss. Anything that finds its way into our mouth in the process could soon be building its empire in the world of our gut. Whether it will continue to prevail will remain to be seen. And whether its intentions are good or bad will also remain to be seen. So, we could say we gather our own fate with our mouth. Stool samples can show what comes out the other end. It’s a game with many unknowns.</p>
<p class="c8">We receive some help creating this collection—mainly from our mother. No matter how many sloppy kisses we give to the car window, if we are allowed to kiss and cuddle with our mother regularly, we will be protected by her microbes. Breast-feeding also promotes particular members of our gut flora—breast-milk-loving <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacteria</em>, for example. Colonizing the gut so early, these bacteria are instrumental in the <a id="page_163" class="calibre2"></a>development of later bodily functions, such as those of the immune system or the metabolic system. Children with insufficient <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacteria</em> in their gut in their first year have an increased risk of obesity in later life compared with infants with large populations.</p>
<p class="c8">There are many, many kinds of bacteria—some beneficial, others less so. Breast-feeding can help shift the balance toward the beneficial and reduce the risk of a later gluten intolerance, for example. A baby’s first population of gut bacteria prepares the way for the mature population by removing oxygen and electrons from the intestine. As soon as the environment is free of oxygen, the more typical bacteria of the gut can start to settle there.</p>
<p class="c8">Breast milk is so beneficial that a more or less well-nourished mother need not do any more than suckle her baby to ensure it is receiving a healthy diet. When it comes to the nutrients it contains, breast milk provides everything that dietary scientists believe children need in order to thrive—it is the best dietary supplement ever. It contains everything, knows everything, and can do everything necessary for a child’s well-being. And, as if that weren’t enough, it has the added advantage of passing on a bit of Mom’s immune system to her offspring. Breast milk contains antibodies that can protect against any dangerous bacteria a child might make the acquaintance of (by licking the family pet, for example).</p>
<p class="c8">Weaning is the first revolution experienced by a baby’s gut flora. Suddenly, the entire composition of Junior’s food supply is different. Clever old Mother Nature has equipped the typical bacteria that first colonize the infant gut with the genes needed to break down simple carbohydrates such as those in rice. Serve Junior complex, plant-based foods like garden peas, for example, and his baby flora will not be able to deal with them alone. He is now going to need new kinds of digestive bacteria. African <a id="page_164" class="calibre2"></a>children have bacteria that can manufacture all kinds of tools needed to break down even the most fibrous of plant-based foods. The microbes in the guts of children with a Western diet prefer to avoid such hard work—and they may do so with a clear conscience since their diet consists primarily of puréed baby food and small amounts of meat.</p>
<p class="c8">Bacteria do not always manufacture the tools they need—sometimes they also borrow them. In Japan, the gut population has entered into a trade relationship with marine bacteria. They borrowed a gene from their sea-living colleagues that helps break down the kind of seaweed used in Japanese cuisine to make sushi, for example. This shows that the composition of our gut population can depend to a large extent on the tools we need to break down certain foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="c8">Useful gut bacteria can be passed on through the generations. Anyone of European heritage who has experienced constipation after a blow-out session at the all-you-can-eat sushi bar will appreciate the advantage of inheriting Japanese seaweed-processing bacteria from someone in the family. However, it is not so easy to infuse yourself or your kids with a few sushi-digesting assistants. Bacteria have to like living in the place where they work.</p>
<p class="c8">If we say a microorganism is particularly suited to our gut, we mean it appreciates the architecture of our gut cells, copes well with the climate, and likes the food on the menu. All three of these factors vary from person to person. Our genes help design our bodies, but they are not the chief architects of our microbial home. Identical twins share the same genes, but they do not have the same bacterial mix. They do not even have noticeably more similarities than other pairs of siblings. Our life-style, random acquaintances, illness, or hobbies all influence the shape of the populations inside our body.</p>
<p class="c8">On the way to a relatively mature gut flora in our third year, we stick all sorts of stuff into our mouth—some of which will <a id="page_165" class="calibre2"></a>be useful and suited to us. We acquire more and more microorganisms, building up our population diversity from a couple of hundred species of bacteria to many hundreds of different gut-dwellers. That would be a pretty impressive inventory for any zoo, yet we acquire this variety without even thinking about it.</p>
<p class="c8">It is now generally accepted that the first populations to colonize our gut lay the main foundations for the future of our entire body. Studies have shown the importance of those first few weeks of postnatal bacteria-collecting for the development of the immune system. Just three weeks after birth, the metabolic products of our gut flora can predict increased risks of allergies, asthma, or neurodermatitis in later life. How do we manage to pick up bacteria that are more harmful than beneficial to us so early in life?</p>
<p class="c8">More than a third of all children in Western, industrialized countries are brought into the world by means of a convenient cesarean section. No squeezing through a narrow birth canal, no unpleasant side effects like perineal tearing, no delivering the afterbirth—it sounds like a fine thing. The initial contact experienced by children born by cesarean section is mainly with other people’s skin. They have to glean bacteria for their gut somehow, since their population will not develop from maternal microbes, like those of children born vaginally. They might end up with bacteria from Nurse Suzy’s right thumb, from the florist who sold Daddy that congratulatory bunch of flowers, or from Granddad’s dog. Suddenly, factors like the motivation of underpaid hospital cleaners become significant. Did they wipe down the telephones, tables, and bathroom faucets with loving care or a lack of conviction?</p>
<p class="c8">Our skin flora is not as strictly controlled as that of the birth canal and is much more exposed to the outside world. Whatever gathers on the skin could soon end up in baby’s belly. These uninvited guests may include pathogens or weird types with strange ways of training the young immune system. Children <a id="page_166" class="calibre2"></a>born by cesarean section take months or even longer to develop a normal population of gut bacteria. Three-quarters of newborn babies who pick up typical hospital germs are those born by cesarean section. They also have an increased risk of developing allergies or asthma. One American study showed that administering <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus</em> to those babies can reduce their risk of developing allergies. The same treatment has no effect at all on children born naturally—one could say they were dipped in the probiotic waters of the Styx while they were being born.</p>
<p class="c8">By the age of seven, there is barely any discernible difference between the gut flora of children born naturally and those born by cesarean section—the early stages, when the immune and metabolic systems are still impressionable, are long gone. Indeed, cesarean births are not the exclusive cause of less-than-ideal starting populations in the gut. Poor nutrition, unnecessary use of antibiotics, excessive cleanliness, or too much exposure to bad bacteria can also feature among the causes. In spite of all this, there is no reason for anyone to feel inadequate. We humans are large creatures, and there is no way we can exercise control over every aspect of our microscopic world.</p>
