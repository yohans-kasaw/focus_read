<p class="c7"><strong class="calibre6">D</strong><small class="calibre7">OING ACADEMIC RESEARCH</small> is like walking through unfamiliar territory in the fog. There are few people who would wish to do that every day, happily snapping photos of the new bushes or buildings that emerge from the mist. Sometimes, you can follow a thread for ages, only to find that it is your own sweater that is unraveling. And when that happens, coming home and telling your loved ones what discoveries you’ve made is not quite so cool.</p>
<p class="c8">A couple of years ago, we knew that some depressed mice could be cheered up by certain bacteria, and we knew of rats whose character changed completely when other rats’ gut bacteria were transplanted into their bodies, and thus the term “psychobiotics” was coined. It describes microbes that have psychological effects—and which may even be useful in treating conditions like depression. But those animal studies still left us wondering whether such psychobiotics could actually affect humans’ mental health.</p>
<p class="c8">There are now some twenty reliable studies of this kind involving human subjects. Three of the bacteria cocktails tested appeared to have no such effect, but all the rest (and this is <a id="page_265" class="calibre2"></a>the more exciting piece of news) do influence the human psyche. Overall, a realistic view of the picture so far is that bacteria don’t cause sudden mood swings; rather, their effect on our emotional state is gradual, often not appearing until three to four weeks after the microbes are administered, and their effect may be fairly limited. Medical thought has also undergone a development when it comes to stress, and the gut has been recognized as playing an important role.</p>
<p class="c8">What exactly is going on here, and how strong the effects might be, are still under investigation, with nearly every research team concentrating on different kinds of bacteria.</p>
<p class="c14"><span class="c15"><strong class="calibre4">Mood</strong></span></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">FOR RESEARCHERS CONDUCTING</small> experiments into our mood, a stimulating initial question is: what emotions constitute our moods? What are they made up of, so to speak? Most researchers try to answer this with the aid of questionnaires. The many different kinds of questions are categorized according to ranges of feelings: from depressive to cheerful, from fearful to self-assured, from quick-tempered to sweet-tempered, from being concerned (for example, about personal physical well-being) to being positive, and so on.</p>
<p class="c8">And that is how a group of English researchers began their first, tentative trials. <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus casei Shirota</em> (a bacterium you may know from the yogurt drinks available at most supermarkets) improved the disposition of the most ill-tempered third of their test subjects after they had taken it for only three weeks, from “depressive” toward “cheerful.” The subjects with a better general mood saw no further improvement in their spirits, and other feelings, such as anger or anxiety, were not affected to any significant degree.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_266" class="calibre2"></a>That was not the case for a study carried out in France. Scientists wanted to investigate a combination of two types of bacteria (<em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium longum</em> and <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus helveticus</em>, which are often found in their abbreviated forms, <em class="calibre8">B. longum</em> and <em class="calibre8">L. helveticus</em>, in lists of ingredients). After four weeks, the test subjects experienced a positive improvement not only in their depressive tendencies, but also in parameters such as anger; or, for example, they showed a propensity to perceive their own physical aches and pains as less severe.</p>
<p class="c8">A Dutch team took a more specific approach to the category of mood itself. They were particularly interested in a certain kind of mood: those minor, recurrent, routine lows familiar to everybody, even those of a perfectly healthy mental constitution. Nothing terrible has happened, and we really can’t even pinpoint what’s causing our bad mood—we just feel less perky than usual. Such moments of gloom rarely warrant a mention in our day-to-day conversations or in the media—but they are currently a hot topic among research psychologists. What the researchers are interested in is not the blues themselves, but how we react to them.</p>
<p class="c8">This is among the most accurate indicators of whether a healthy person might develop depression or not. Above all, studies have repeatedly shown that the least favorable reaction is fretful brooding—about who might be to blame for our woes, for example.</p>
<p class="c8">In this study, the test subjects were asked to spend several minutes imagining themselves in the following situation. It’s definitely not your day today, you don’t feel in top form, but nothing serious has happened to put you in this mood. The subjects then evaluated their own reaction to this mood, according to statements such as the following.</p>
<p class="c8">“When I feel that way, I have much less patience and I lose my temper more quickly.”</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_267" class="calibre2"></a>“When I feel that way, I brood a lot over everything that’s wrong with my life at the moment, or about what my life might have been like if it had taken a different turn.”</p>
<p class="c8">Or, “When I’m down, I feel that everything is hopeless.”</p>
<p class="c8">In the fine old tradition of test questionnaires, the subjects were given the following five options to rate on a scale of 0 to 4: Nope, never really / Rarely / Sometimes / Often / Oh yes — absolutely!</p>
<p class="c8">Before they began taking the bacteria, the test subjects’ average scores were about 43 out of a total of 136 points. Thus, they were within the healthy average range and did not display any brooding, angry, or despairing tendencies. They then took the bacteria mixture every day for four weeks. Mouth open, powder in, swallow it down. The group that were given a placebo (without their knowledge) barely changed their responses at all. But those who took the real bacteria improved their scores—in particular, in two areas, anger and brooding—by about 10 percent at least (which means roughly half the questions in those areas were answered one degree more positively).</p>
<p class="c8">This is not the same effect as would have been achieved if they had been given cocaine—or a powerful tranquilizer—but it is also not the same effect as that of the placebo. Results like these lead us to the question of how great the gut’s influence on our mood is. They also raise the question of what aspects of our mood it can affect.</p>
<p class="c14"><span class="c15"><strong class="calibre4">Stress</strong></span></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">WHILE MOOD CAN</small> be seen as originating in various parts of our nervous system, stress is better described as the state the nervous system is in. A stressed nervous system is like a taut bowstring—in a constant state of alertness and sensitive to <a id="page_268" class="calibre2"></a>any external stimulus. Such a state is excellent for tackling an obstacle course or reacting to a dangerous situation while driving. However, as a permanent condition, such a state is pretty costly. . . comparable to taking a monster truck to drive to the supermarket around the corner. The gut lends the brain a large amount of energy in order to deal with the stress (see <a href="part0017.html#page_133" class="calibre2">page 133</a>). Could our guts also help relieve feelings of stress? As a way of helping themselves, so to speak?</p>
<p class="c8">In this field, the wait for newer results has been worth it, as the research has changed tack. The initial conclusion following the first experiments with human subjects was that a stressful daily routine or a scary exam was always equally stressful or frightening for subjects, no matter which lovely bacteria they fed to their guts. However, it was concluded, microbes could help reduce the physical effects of stress, such as stress hormone levels, nervous stomach aches, nausea, diarrhea, and susceptibility to colds.</p>
<p class="c8">However, a closer examination of those studies reveals an interesting indication. One species of bacteria also altered people’s subjective level of stress—although this appeared to be the case only in one subgroup of subjects: the sleep-deprived ones. Those who slept less in the run-up to an exam were always more stressed. This effect was less pronounced among subjects who swallowed a daily dose of <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium bifidum</em>. They were still stressed—but a little less so than their peers who slept equally badly but did not get the bacterium.</p>
<p class="c8">In this study, 581 subjects were divided into four groups a couple of weeks before the study began. One group received capsules containing a powder with no bacteria; the other three groups were each given a different type of bacteria: <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium bifidum</em>, <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus helveticus</em>, and <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium infantis</em>. <em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus helveticus</em> and <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium infantis</em>, however, did not show the same effect as <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium bifidum</em>.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_269" class="calibre2"></a>The result with <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium bifidum</em> encouraged scientists to investigate the microbial world in more depth—after all, a bacterium had now been found that managed something no other bacterium had been shown to do: reduce feelings of stress. It was not long before new results emerged from Ireland. Some researchers—those who had also carried out the experiment with the swimming mice (see <a href="part0017.html#page_126" class="calibre2">page 126</a>)—now ventured into the arena of human trials. One particular Bifidobacterium (<em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium longum</em> 1714) had shown itself to be highly effective in their experiments with mice. It reduced stress parameters and improved the lab animals’ memory. So the Irish scientists tested it on a small group of human animals.</p>
<p class="c8">The participants in this study were asked to fill out an online questionnaire about their feelings of stress every day. They were also called into the lab three times within a period of eight weeks, in order to do the following:</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">1.</span>Put on a funny helmet.</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">2.</span>Plunge one of their hands into ice-cold water.</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">3.</span>Solve mental puzzles on a tablet PC.</p>
<p class="c30">THE FUNCTION OF the funny helmet was to measure the activity levels in various parts of the subjects’ brains. If you were to make your beloved wear this helmet while you were telling him or her about your boring day at the office, you would be able to watch as the level of activity in the listening area of their brain slowly declined and the day-dreaming regions revved up for a party.</p>
<p class="c8">Plunging subjects’ hands into unbearably cold water is a tried-and-true method of assessing their stress levels. A measurement is taken of the amount of time subjects are able to keep their hands in the icy water, while swabbing their mouths regularly with cotton buds. The cotton buds absorb saliva, which can be analyzed to measure the amount of stress hormones it <a id="page_270" class="calibre2"></a>contains. No matter how often the test is repeated, the subjects’ reactions are always the same. A nervous system that signals stress due to cold is not a creature of habit—it does not get less sensitive over time when exposed to low temperatures repeatedly or for a long period of time. If it did, we would perceive the weather as getting increasingly warmer as winter progressed.</p>
<p class="c8">As soon as the test subjects had had enough and rescued their hands from their freezing fate, they were asked a number of questions. The researchers wanted to know how anxious they felt immediately after experiencing a rush of excited hormones.</p>
<p class="c8">Almost every parameter was different in some way after a four-week course of Bifidobacteria. In the online questionnaires, the test subjects reported around 15 percent lower levels of day-to-day stress, as compared with the subjects who received a placebo. The cold-water, hand-immersion test still triggered the same reaction (as expected—after all, the water was still freezing cold), but with an overall stress hormone level that was lower than before. Furthermore, those hormones did not lead to increased anxiety.</p>
<p class="c8">The electrode helmet and tablet-based teasers were also not simply for the researchers’ amusement. The “bacteria group” made around two to five fewer mistakes in the memory tasks, compared with the placebo group (who made one to three fewer mistakes)—already a successful result. This effect was also made visible by the helmet. One area of the brain that we use for learning, and which becomes weaker in patients with Alzheimer’s, now showed increased activity. The placebo had no such effect—but with the bacteria, it was clear.</p>
<p class="c8">Our gut can send impulses to the brain—for example, via nerve fibers (see <a href="part0017.html#page_126" class="calibre2">page 126</a>). The Irish research team came up with another possible explanation—bacteria could have improved memory function by reducing the subjects’ stress-hormone levels. That might work like this: the brain structure that <a id="page_271" class="calibre2"></a>stores our memories and links them to each other (the hippocampus) is very densely populated with sensors that detect stress hormones. If the hippocampus registers large amounts of such hormones, the brain cuts back the level of activity there. After all, if you are running away from a wild animal, you don’t need to waste energy remembering which plants you pass by. During stressful times in our lives, we develop a kind of tunnel vision—to enable us to direct our attention to the problem at hand.</p>
<p class="c8">This observation is interesting—not only for fans of <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium longum</em> 1714, but also for patients with gut conditions who find it difficult to concentrate as well as usual during a flare-up, and for school students, for example, who have trouble cooperating with their brains during a tough test. In the end, it may not really matter whether the state of stress is reported by the gut or the brain. Both organs are able to use the nervous system and messenger substances in the blood to stimulate the adrenal gland (the organ that eventually produces stress hormones). And this is precisely where we may return to the issue of mood.</p>
<p class="c8">Let’s go back to those little, day-to-day downers studied by the group of Dutch scientists. Remember—no matter how nice our lives may be, we all have them from time to time. Those who tend to react to such a mood by brooding over their problems will find that our modern world offers a rich palette of problems to ponder. Even more importantly, these are often problems we can do nothing about. Some politician somewhere in the world says something stupid, but in the past hardly anyone would have got wind of it. Elsewhere, a plane comes down, killing an entire football team you would never otherwise have heard about. Someone or other puts a picture of her perfect life online, and we end up comparing ourselves unfavorably to something we would never have seen in the past.</p>
<p class="c8"><a id="page_272" class="calibre2"></a>If we engage in it enough, brooding over problems that cannot be changed can result in feelings of stress. The resultant stress hormones serve to increase that tunnel vision. And it becomes increasingly difficult for us to see anything beyond our own problems. And this, in turn, further increases our level of stress. <em class="calibre8">Voilà</em>: we have a vicious circle. A physiological system that was meant to help us in times of stress is thus co-opted, and we increasingly slide into a behavior pattern of “stressed griping,” rather than directly observing the world around us, asking inquisitive questions, or taking care of our well-being.</p>
<p class="c14"><span class="c15"><strong class="calibre4">Depression</strong></span></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">THE CURRENT STATE</small> of research indicates that our gut has about a 10- to 15-percent influence on feelings of melancholy, anger, or stress. It tells the brain what is happening inside us, and that information may be worrying or reassuring. So it could be partly responsible when we slide into a certain mood. However, this says nothing about the extent of the gut’s involvement in the process of emerging from a period of fully fledged depression.</p>
<p class="c8">Preliminary experiments aimed at answering this question give cause for optimism. A group of Irish researchers, for example, harvested gut bacteria from people with depression and implanted them in rats. This is not the kind of microbial exchange that happens when you shake hands with someone: the scientists first removed all other microbes from the rats’ intestinal system and then administered highly concentrated doses of the harvested bacteria. The rats developed depressive behaviors that they had not displayed previously.</p>
<p class="c8">When it comes to purely human experiments, research is still at a very early stage. A common tool in such research is the <a id="page_273" class="calibre2"></a>Becks Depression Inventory psychometric test. This test helps scientists determine the severity of a patient’s depression (and, for example, whether they are dealing with a case of clinical depression or a temporary bout of the blues). Perhaps surprisingly, the list of twenty-one questions does not only ask respondents whether they feel sad or dissatisfied; it also includes questions about problems with sleeping, difficulty making decisions, increasing health worries, or a noticeable lack of interest in sex (compared with the past). Basically, these are indirect questions about the various hormone systems in our body.</p>
<p class="c8">So far, there are only two studies that have investigated, under controlled conditions, the effect of probiotic bacteria on depression. The first study, in 2015, found that a combination of two kinds of bacteria (<em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus acidophilus</em> and <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium bifidum</em>) and medication improved patients’ condition, but the effect was slight once all possible interference factors were removed from the calculations. And a study in 2017 found that two types of bacteria (<em class="calibre8">Lactobacillus helveticus</em> and <em class="calibre8">Bifidobacterium longum</em>) had no influence on depression. However, the researchers did find an indication that a patient’s vitamin D level may influence this effect. In test subjects with sufficiently high levels of vitamin D in their blood, the microbes appeared to improve their mood; however, the overall number of subjects was too small to allow a scientific conclusion from this study.</p>
<p class="c8">These are the first two steps on a new journey in research. If we continue down this path, we will eventually see which way it is leading us. Could we perhaps use the gut to prevent depression before it occurs? Are bacteria better suited as a complementary treatment, to be used alongside medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes? Or should treatments for depression perhaps target multiple possible causes at once—that is, the gut (via bacteria and diet), the brain (with drugs and therapy), and <a id="page_274" class="calibre2"></a>other possible causes (such as vitamin levels, physical activity, or working conditions)? It may also be the case that there are many different kinds of depression—some for which the influence of the gut is greater and therefore more important in their treatment, and others for which this is not the case.</p>
<p class="c8">The goal of this journey should not be to discover some kind of super-bug, which we would all take a daily dose of. The aim is also not to produce a population of permanently happy people. Rather, the aim should be to reach a better understanding of our bodies and how we live in them. This includes being aware of what is going on inside our bodies, rather than looking only for external causes of stress or mood swings. If we were to discover particularly effective microbes to support us along the way, that would be an excellent thing. But while scientists are still searching through the fog, we should learn to appreciate what we already have: good microbes inside us and around us, and ancient knowledge, to which we should pay much more heed.</p>
