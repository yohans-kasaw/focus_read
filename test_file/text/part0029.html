<p class="c7"><strong class="calibre6">T</strong><small class="calibre7">HIS BOOK WOULD</small> not exist if it weren’t for my sister, Jill. Without your free, rational, and inquisitive mind, I would have been stuck many times in a world where obedience and conformity are easier than courage and the will to make necessary mistakes. Although you lead a busy life yourself, you were always there, ready to go through my texts with me and inspire me with new ideas. You taught me how to work creatively. Whenever I feel bad, I remember we are made of the same stuff and each of us uses her talents differently. I would like to thank Ambrosius, who shielded me from too much work with a protective arm. I would also like to thank my family and my godfather for surrounding me like a forest surrounds a tree, keeping me rooted even when strong winds are blowing. I also thank Ji-Won for keeping me nourished so often during the writing of this book—with food and her wonderful nature. My thanks go to Anne-Claire and Anne for their help with even the trickiest of questions!</p>
<p class="c8">I thank Michaela and Bettina, without whose sharp minds the writing of this book would never have come about. If it weren’t for my medical studies I would never have had the knowledge necessary to write this book, so I thank all my good teachers and professors, as well as the German state, which pays for my university studies. To everyone who has contributed their hard work to the realization of this book—from press officers, publishers, manufacturers, printers, marketers, proofreaders, booksellers, postal workers, to those of you reading this now: Thank you!</p>
