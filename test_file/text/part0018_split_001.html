The Earth itself is easily identified—a bright, round spot among the other bright spots in the darkness of space. Closing in a little, it becomes apparent that we humans inhabit all sorts of different places on the planet. Our cities shine at night as patches of light. Some groups are concentrated in big urban centers, others live scattered over wide areas. We inhabit the cool northern climes of Europe and North America, but we also occupy tropical rainforests and the margins of arid deserts. We are everywhere, even though we are invisible from space.</p>
<p class="c8">Looking closer at human beings, it becomes clear that each of us is a world of our own. Our forehead is a breezy meadow, our elbows are arid wastelands, our eyes are salty lakes, and our gut is the most amazing giant forest ever, populated by the weirdest of creatures. Just as we humans occupy the planet, our bodies are occupied by a population that reveals itself only under the microscope—bacteria. Viewed at great magnification, they resemble bright, little spots against a dark background.</p>
<p class="c8">For many centuries, humans concerned themselves with the human-sized world. We measured it, examined its flora and fauna, and philosophized about life. We constructed huge machines and flew to the Moon. Explorers keen to discover new continents today must turn to the microscopic world within <a id="page_146" class="calibre2"></a>us. Our gut is perhaps the most fascinating continent of that world. It provides the habitat for more species and families of creatures than any other landscape. Exploration of this region is only now beginning in earnest. A new sense of excitement is brewing among scientists, not unlike that associated with the decoding of the human genome and all the promise that holds for the future. Of course, this excitement about gut research could still fizzle and come to nothing.</p>
<p class="c8">Work on an atlas of human bacteria did not begin until 2007. This project involves taking cotton swab samples from all over the bodies of lots and lots of people. Samples are collected from three different areas of their mouths, under their armpits, and on their foreheads. Stool samples are analyzed and genital smears are evaluated. Places once thought to be bacteria-free turn out to be populated after all—the lungs, for example. When it comes to drawing up a bacteria atlas, the gut is the supreme challenge. Of our entire microbiome—that is, all the microorganisms that teem on the inside and outside of our bodies—99 percent are found in the gut. Not because there are so few elsewhere, but because there are simply so inconceivably many in the gut.</p>
