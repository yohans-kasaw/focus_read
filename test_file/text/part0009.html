<p class="c6"><img src="../images/00004.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="c7"><strong class="calibre6">T</strong><small class="calibre7">HE MOST IMPORTANT</small> phase of our digestion takes place in the small intestine, where the maximum surface area meets the maximum reduction of our food down to the tiniest pieces. This is where the decisions are made. Can we tolerate lactose? Is this food good for our health? Which food causes allergic reactions? Here, in this final stage of breakdown, our digestive enzymes work like tiny pairs of scissors. They snip away at our food until it shares a lowest common denominator with our cells. Canny as ever, Mother Nature here makes use of the fact that all living things are made out of the same basic ingredients: sugar molecules, amino acids, and fats. Everything we eat comes from living things—at this biological level, there is no difference between an apple, a tree, and a cow.</p>
<p class="c8">Sugar molecules can be linked to form complex chains. When that happens, they no longer taste sweet, and we know them as the carbohydrates we find in bread, pasta, or rice. After that piece of toast you ate for breakfast has undergone the snipping of the enzyme scissors, the final product is the same number of sugar molecules as a couple of spoonfuls of refined household sugar. The only difference is that household sugar does not require so much work from our enzymes as it is already broken down into such small pieces when it arrives <a id="page_49" class="calibre2"></a>in the small intestine that it can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream. Eating too much pure sugar at once really does make our blood sweeter for a while.</p>
<p class="c8">The sugar contained in white toast is digested relatively quickly by our enzymes. With wholegrain bread, everything moves at a much more leisurely pace. Such bread contains particularly complex sugar chains, which have to be broken down bit by bit. So, wholegrain bread is not a sugar explosion, but a beneficial sugar store. Incidentally, our body has to work much harder to restore a healthy balance if a sugar onrush comes suddenly. It pumps out large amounts of various hormones, most importantly insulin. The result is that we rapidly feel tired again once this special operation is over. If it doesn’t enter the system too quickly, sugar is an important raw material for our body. It is used as fuel for our cells—like heat-giving firewood—or to build sugar structures for use in our body, such as the antler-like glycocalyxes attached to our gut cells.</p>
<p class="c8">Despite the problems, our body loves sugary sweet treats because they save the body work, since sugar can be taken up more quickly. The same is true of warm proteins. In addition, sugar can be turned into energy extremely quickly, and our brain rewards us for a rush of rapid energy by making us feel good. However, there is one problem: never before, in the history of humankind, have we been faced with such a huge abundance of readily available sugar. Some 80 percent of the processed foods found on the shelves of modern-day American supermarkets contain added sugar. On an evolutionary scale, then, we could say our species has just discovered the secret stash of candies at the back of the cupboard, and it keeps returning to binge on the booty before collapsing on the couch with a stomachache and sugar shock.</p>
<p class="c8">Even though we know intellectually that too much snacking is bad for us, we can’t really blame our instincts for encouraging us to grab every opportunity for a treat. When we eat too much <a id="page_50" class="calibre2"></a>sugar, our body simply stores it away for leaner times. Quite practical, really. One way the body does this is by relinking the molecules to form long, complex chains of a substance called glycogen, which is then stored in the liver. Another strategy is to convert the excess sugar into fat and store it in fatty tissue. Sugar is the only substance our body can turn into fat with little effort.</p>
<p class="c8">Glycogen reserves are soon used up—just about the time during your run when you notice the exercise is suddenly much harder work. That is why nutritional physiologists say we should do at least an hour’s exercise if we want to burn fat. It is not until we pass through that first energy dip that we start to tap into those fine reserves. We might find it annoying that our paunch isn’t the first thing to go, but our body is deaf to such complaints. The simple reason for this is that human cells adore fat.</p>
<p class="c8">Fat is the most valuable and efficient of all food particles. The atoms are so cleverly combined that they can concentrate twice as much energy per ounce as carbohydrates or protein. We use fat to coat our nerves—just like the plastic on an electric cable. It is this coating that makes us such fast thinkers. Some of the most important hormones in our body are made out of fat, and every single one of our cells is wrapped in a membrane made largely of fat. Such a special substance must be protected and not squandered at the first sign of physical exertion. When the next period of famine comes—and there have been many over the eons—every ounce of fat in that paunch is a life insurance policy.</p>
<p class="c8">Our small intestine also knows the special value of fat. Unlike other nutrients, it cannot be absorbed straight into the blood from the gut. Fat is not soluble in water—it would immediately clog the tiny blood capillaries in the villi of the gut and float on top of the blood in larger vessels, like the oil on <a id="page_51" class="calibre2"></a>spaghetti water. So fat must be absorbed via a different route: the lymphatic system. Lymphatic vessels are to blood vessels as Robin is to Batman. Every blood vessel inside the body is accompanied by a lymphatic vessel, even each tiny capillary in the small intestine. While our blood vessels are thick and red and heroically pump nutrients to our tissues, the lymphatic vessels are thin and filmy white in color. They drain away fluid that is pumped out of our tissue and transport the immune cells, whose job it is to ensure that everything is as it should be throughout the body.</p>
<p class="c8">Lymphatic vessels are so slight because they do not have muscular walls like our blood vessels. Often, they work just by using gravity. That explains why we sometimes wake up in the morning with swollen eyes. Gravity is not very much help when you are lying down. The tiny lymphatic vessels in our face are nicely open, but it is only when we get up and gravity kicks in that the fluid transported there during the night by our blood vessels can flow back down. (The reason our lower legs do not fill up with fluid after a long day on our feet is that our leg muscles squeeze the lymphatic vessels every time we take a step and that squeezes the fluid—known as lymph in medical circles—upwards.) The lymphatic system is seen as an underappreciated weakling everywhere in the body except in the small intestine. This is its time to shine! All the body’s lymph vessels converge in an impressively thick duct, where all the digested fat can gather without the risk of clogging.</p>
<p class="c8">It’s well known that doctors like to show off their Latin skills, and they give this vessel the mighty sounding name <em class="calibre8">ductus thoracicus.</em> It sounds almost as if it means to say, “Hail, Ductus! Teach us why noble fat is so important and evil fat so bad!” Shortly after we eat a fatty meal, there are so many tiny fat droplets in our <em class="calibre8">ductus</em> or thoracic duct that the lymph fluid is no longer transparent but milky white. When the fat has gathered, <a id="page_53" class="calibre2"></a>the thoracic duct skirts the belly, passes through the diaphragm, and heads straight for the heart. (All the fluid drained from our legs, eyelids, and gut ends up here.) So, whether it’s extra virgin olive oil or cheap fat from french fries, it all goes straight into the heart—there is no detoxing detour via the liver as there is for everything else we digest.</p>
<div class="c17">

<p class="c18"><em class="calibre8">A = Blood vessels pass through the liver and then go on to the heart. B = Lymphatic vessels go straight to the heart.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="c8">Detoxification of dangerous, bad fat takes place only after the heart has given the fat-laden fluid a powerful push to pump it through the system and the droplets of fat happen to end up in one of the blood vessels of the liver. The liver contains quite a large amount of blood, and so the probability is high that such a meeting will take place sooner rather than later, but before that happens, our heart and our blood vessels are at the mercy of everything that McDonald’s and similar fast-food outlets were able to get hold of at the lowest purchase price.</p>
<p class="c8">Just as bad fat can have a negative effect, good fat can work wonders. Those who are prepared to spend that little bit extra on cold-pressed (extra virgin) olive oil will be dunking their baguette in a soothing balm for their heart and blood vessels. Many studies have been carried out into the effects of olive oil, and results show that it can protect against arteriosclerosis, cellular stress, Alzheimer’s, and eye diseases such as macular degeneration. It also appears to have beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and help in protecting against certain kinds of cancer. Of particular interest to those fighting fat is that olive oil also has the potential to help get rid of that spare tire. It blocks an enzyme in fatty tissue—known as fatty acid synthase—that likes to create fat out of spare carbohydrates. And we are not the only ones who</p>
<p class="c18"><a id="page_54" class="calibre2"></a>benefit from the properties of olive oil—the good bacteria in our gut also appreciate a little pampering.</p>
<p class="c8">Good-quality olive oil costs a little bit more. However, it tastes neither greasy nor rancid, but rather green and fruity, and it sometimes leaves a peppery feeling in your throat after you swallow it. This is due to the tannins it contains. If this description sounds too abstract, simply try out various oils to find the best, using the various quality seals as a guide.</p>
<p class="c8">But merrily drizzling your olive oil into the pan for frying is not such a good idea as heat can cause a lot of damage. Hotplates are great for frying up steaks or eggs, but they are not good for oily fatty acids, which can be chemically altered by heat. Cooking oil or solid fats such as butter or hydrogenated coconut oil should be used for frying. They may be full of the much-frowned-upon saturated fats, but they are much more stable when exposed to heat.</p>
<p class="c8">Fine oils are not only sensitive to heat, they also tend to capture free radicals from the air. Free radicals do a lot of damage to our bodies because they don’t actually like being free, much preferring to bond with other substances. They can latch onto almost anything—blood vessels, facial skin, or nerve cells—causing inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis), aging of the skin, or nerve disease. That’s why you should always close the bottle or container of olive oil carefully after use and keep it in the fridge.</p>
<p class="c8">The animal fats found in meat, milk, and eggs contain far more arachidonic acid than vegetable fats. Arachidonic acid is converted in our body into neurotransmitters involved in the sensation of pain. Oils such as rapeseed (canola), linseed, or hempseed oil, on the other hand, contain more of the anti-inflammatory substance alpha-linolenic acid, while olive oil contains a substance with a similar effect called oleocanthal. These fats work in a similar way to ibuprofen or aspirin, but in <a id="page_55" class="calibre2"></a>much smaller doses. So, although they are no help if you have an acute headache, using these oils regularly can help those who suffer from inflammatory disease, regular headaches, or menstrual pain. Sometimes, pain levels can be reduced somewhat simply by taking care to eat more vegetable fat than animal fat.</p>
<p class="c8">However, olive oil should not be seen as a panacea for all skin and hair conditions. Dermatological studies have shown that pure olive oil can even irritate the skin slightly, and that using olive oil as a hair treatment leaves hair so oily that the amount of washing required to remove the oil negates any possible beneficial effects.</p>
<p class="c8">It is easy to overdo it with fats inside our bodies, too. Large amounts—of either good or bad fat—are simply too much for the body to deal with. It’s comparable to smearing too much moisturizer on your face. Nutritional physiologists recommend we get between 25 and a maximum of 30 percent of our daily energy requirement from fat. That works out at an average of 2 to 2½ ounces (55 to 66 grams) of fat a day. Larger, more athletic types may consume a little more; smaller, more sedentary types should try to consume a little less. This means if you eat just one Big Mac, you will have conveniently covered half your daily requirement of fat—the only question is, with what kind of fat? A sweet onion chicken teriyaki sandwich from the fast-food chain Subway contains less than 1/6 of an ounce of fat (only 4.5 grams). How you consume the other 2 ounces (53 grams) is then entirely up to you.</p>
<p class="c8">Having examined carbohydrates and fats, there is just one more nutritional building block to consider. It is probably the least familiar: amino acids. It seems strange to imagine, but both tofu, with its neutral-to-nutty taste, and salty, savory meat are made up of lots of tiny acids. As with carbohydrates, these tiny building blocks are linked in chains. This is what gives them their different taste and a different name—proteins. <a id="page_56" class="calibre2"></a>Digestive enzymes break down these chains in the small intestine and then the gut wall nabs the valuable components. There are twenty of these amino acids and an infinite variety of ways they can be linked to form proteins. We humans use them to build many substances, not least of which is our DNA, the genetic material contained in every new cell we produce every day. The same is true of other living things, both plants and animals. That explains why everything nature produces that we can eat contains protein.</p>
<p class="c8">However, maintaining a healthy meat-free diet that does not lead to nutritional deficiencies is more difficult than most people think. Plants construct different proteins than animals, and they often use so little of a given amino acid that the proteins they produce are known as incomplete. When our body tries to use these to make the amino acids it needs, it can continue to build the chain only until one of the amino acids runs out. Half-finished proteins are then simply broken down again, and we excrete the tiny acids in our urine or recycle them in our body. Beans lack the amino acid methionine; rice and wheat (and its derivative meat substitute, seitan) lack lysine; and sweetcorn is, in fact, deficient in two amino acids: lysine and tryptophan. But this does not spell the final triumph of the meat eaters over the meat-avoiders. Vegetarians and vegans simply have to be cleverer in combining their foods.</p>
<p class="c8">Beans may be lacking in methionine, but they are packed with lysine. A wheat tortilla with refried beans and a yummy filling will provide all the amino acids the body needs for healthy protein production. Vegetarians who eat cheese and eggs can compensate for incomplete proteins that way. For centuries in many countries around the world, people have intuitively eaten meals made up of foodstuffs that complement each other: rice and beans, pasta with cheese, pita bread and hummus, or peanut butter on toast. In theory, combining does <a id="page_57" class="calibre2"></a>not even have to take place within one meal. It is enough to take in the right combination over the course of a day. (Thinking about these combinations can often inspire even the most uninventive of cooks when they are trying to decide what to make for dinner.) There are plants that do contain all the necessary amino acids in the necessary quantities. Two of these are soy and quinoa, but others include amaranth, spirulina, buckwheat, and chia seeds. Tofu has a well-deserved reputation as an alternative to meat—with the caveat that increasing numbers of people are developing allergic reactions to it.</p>
