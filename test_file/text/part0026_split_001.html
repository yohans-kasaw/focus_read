At that time, the brain-gut axis was still an extremely new field of research—nearly all the studies carried out until then had been on animals, and so the area was more one of speculation and hypotheses than hard facts. I was determined to include information about the experiments and theories that existed; but, at the same time, I was anxious to avoid raising false hopes or spreading half-truths by jumping the academic gun, so to speak. As I sat sniffling at my sister’s kitchen table one gray Thursday, moaning that I wouldn’t be able to come up with a text that was both accurate and clear enough, she eventually told me, almost as a command, “Put your head down and just write up what you understand of it, and if there’s more or better information in a few years’ time, I’m sure you can add it then.” And that’s exactly what I’ve done.</p>
