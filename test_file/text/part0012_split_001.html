<p class="c29" id="calibre_pb_1"><strong class="calibre6"><a id="page_79" class="calibre2"></a>T</strong>HERE ARE PLACES where the unconscious and the conscious meet. When you are sitting at home, eating your lunch, you may be unaware that your next-door neighbor is just a short distance away, beyond the dividing wall, chomping away on his lunch, too. You might hear the faint creak of his floorboards and suddenly, your awareness reaches out beyond your own four walls. Similarly, there are areas of our own body we are simply unaware of. You don’t feel your organs working away all day long. When you eat a piece of cake, you taste it while it is still in your mouth, and you are also conscious of the beginning of its journey as it passes down your throat after you swallow it. But then, as if by magic, the cake is gone! From then on, what we eat disappears into the realm of what scientists call smooth muscle.</p>
<p class="c8">Smooth muscle is not under our conscious control. Under the microscope, it looks very different from the tissue of the muscles we can control consciously, such as the biceps. We can flex and relax the muscles in our upper arms at will. Such muscles are made up of the tiniest little fibers, lined up so neatly they look as if they were drawn using a ruler.</p>
<p class="c8">The microscopic structure of smooth muscle resembles an organic network, and it moves in mellifluous waves. Our blood vessels are surrounded by smooth muscle tissue, which explains why we blush when we are embarrassed. Smooth <a id="page_80" class="calibre2"></a>muscle tissue slackens in response to emotions such as embarrassment, causing the blood capillaries in the skin of the face to dilate. In many people, stress has the opposite effect, causing the muscles surrounding the blood vessels to contract, restricting the flow of blood. This can lead to high blood pressure.</p>
<p class="c8">The gut is cosseted by no fewer than three coats of smooth muscle tissue. This makes it incredibly supple and able to execute different choreographies in different places. The choreographer directing these muscles is the gut’s own (enteric) nervous system. The enteric nervous system controls all processes that take place in the digestive tract, and it is extraordinarily autonomous. If the connection between the enteric nervous system and the brain is severed, the digestive tract carries blithely on as if nothing has happened. This property is unique to the enteric nervous system and is found nowhere else in the human body—without directions from our brain, our legs would be lame and our lungs would no longer be able to breathe. It is a shame that we are oblivious to the workings of these independent-minded nerve fibers. Burping or breaking wind might sound a bit gross, but the movements involved are as delicate and complex as those of a ballerina.</p>
