<p class="c7"><strong class="calibre6">W</strong><small class="calibre7">E ARE FAMILIAR</small> with bacteria—those little creatures consisting of a single cell. Some live in boiling hot springs in Iceland, while others luxuriate in the moisture on a dog’s wet nose. Some require oxygen to produce energy and “breathe” almost like us and others die when exposed to the fresh air. Those who don’t draw their energy from oxygen rely on metal atoms or acids—and that can result in some rather interesting smells. Almost every body smell is, in fact, produced by bacteria. From the pleasant scent of a loved one’s skin to the dog-breath of next-door’s frisky hound—it is all the product of the microscopic world in us, on us, and around us.</p>
<p class="c8">We like to watch athletic surfers as they ride the waves, but we are unaware of the spectacular surfing scenario that takes place in our nasal flora every time we sneeze. We pant and sweat when we exercise, but no one notices how delighted the bacteria who live in our running shoes are over the sudden, summery change in climate. When we take a sneaky bite of cake, we never hear the roar of excited bacteria in our gut, as they gleefully shout, “HERE COMES CA-A-A-KE!” It would take an entire international news agency to report on all the events constantly unfolding in just one person’s microbiome. While <a id="page_148" class="calibre2"></a>we lounge about feeling bored, any number of exciting things are happening inside us.</p>
<p class="c8">People are slowly beginning to realize that the vast majority of bacteria are harmless, or even helpful. Some facts are now known to science. Our gut’s microbiome can weigh up to 4½ pounds (2 kilos) and contains about 100 trillion bacteria. One-thirty-second of an ounce (1 gram) of feces contains more bacteria than there are people on Earth. We also know that this community of microbes cracks open indigestible foodstuffs for us, supplies the gut with energy, manufactures vitamins, breaks down toxins and medications, and trains our immune system. Different bacteria manufacture different substances: acids, gases, fats. You could say bacteria are tiny factories. We know that gut bacteria are responsible for blood groups and that harmful bacteria cause diarrhea.</p>
<p class="c8">What we don’t know is what all this means for each individual. We notice pretty quickly when we have ingested diarrhea-causing bacteria. But what do we notice of the work carried out by the many millions, billions, trillions of tiny creatures inside us every day? Does the precise nature of the creatures that colonize us make a difference? Skewed proportions of the different bacteria in our gut have been detected in those suffering from obesity, malnutrition, nervous diseases, depression, and chronic digestive problems. In other words, when something is wrong with our microbiome, something goes wrong with us.</p>
<p class="c8">One person might have stronger nerves than another because she has a better stock of vitamin B–producing bacteria. Another person might be able to deal easily with bit of bread mold eaten by mistake. Yet another might have a tendency to <a id="page_150" class="calibre2"></a>gain weight because the “chubby” bacteria in his gut feed him a bit too willingly. Science is just beginning to understand that each of us is an entire ecosystem. Microbiome research is still young, complete with wobbly milk teeth and short pants.</p>

<p class="c8">When scientists still knew very little about bacteria, they classified them as plants. This explains terms like gut flora, which is not scientifically accurate, but it is appropriately descriptive. A bit like plants, different bacteria have different characteristics concerning their habitat, nutrition, or level of toxicity. The scientifically correct terms are microbiota (which means “little life”) and microbiome, to refer to our collection of microbes and their genes.</p>
<p class="c8">In general, it is accurate to say that the number of bacteria is smaller in the upper sections of the digestive tract, while a very, very large number reside in the lower parts, such as the large intestine and the rectum. Some bacteria prefer the small intestine; others live exclusively in the colon. There are great fans of the appendix, well-behaved homebodies that stick to the mucus membrane, and rather cheekier chaps that nestle up close to the cells of our gut.</p>
<p class="c8">It is not always easy to get to know our gut microbes personally. They don’t like to be removed from their own world. When scientists try to grow them in the lab to observe them, they simply refuse to cooperate. Skin bacteria merrily gobble up the lab food and grow into little microbe mountains—gut bacteria don’t. More than half the bacteria that grow in our digestive tract are just too well adapted to living there to be able to survive outside the gut. Our gut is their world. It keeps them warm, moist, protected from oxygen, and supplied with pretasted food.</p>
<p class="c8">Only ten years ago, many scientists would probably have maintained that there is a stable stock of gut bacteria that is more or less common to every human being. For example, when they spread feces on a culture medium, they always found <em class="calibre8"><a id="page_151" class="calibre2"></a>E. coli</em> bacteria. It was as simple as that. Today, we have machines that can scan tiny amounts of feces molecule by molecule. This reveals the genetic remains of billions of bacteria. We now know that <em class="calibre8">E. coli</em> make up less than 1 percent of the population in the gut. Our gastrointestinal tract is home to more than a thousand different species of bacteria—plus minority populations of viruses and yeasts, as well as fungi and various other single-celled organisms.</p>
<p class="c8">You might think our immune system would pounce on this multitude of settlers. Defending the body from foreign invasions is high on the immune system’s to-do list. Sometimes it even wages war on tiny pollen grains that accidently get sucked into our nostrils. Hay fever sufferers know the signs: a streaming nose and itchy eyes. So, how do the bacteria sidestep the immune system and stage a bacterial Woodstock inside our bodies?</p>
