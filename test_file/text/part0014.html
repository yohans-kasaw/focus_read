<p class="c7"><strong class="calibre6">T</strong><small class="calibre7">HE STOMACH CAN</small> sometimes stumble. Its smooth muscle tissue can trip up just like the striated muscles of the legs. When that stumble causes a substance like gastric acid to reach places that are not designed to deal with it, it hurts. Reflux is the regurgitation of gastric acid and digestive enzymes into the pharyngeal area; in the case of heartburn, those juices travel no farther than the end of the esophagus, causing a burning sensation in the chest.</p>
<p class="c8">Reflux has the same cause as stumbling: it’s all down to the nerves. They control our muscles. If the nerves in our eyes fail to detect a doorstep in time, our legs receive incorrect information and carry on walking as if there were no obstacle in the way—and we stumble. When the nerves of our digestive system receive incorrect information, they fail to keep our gastric juices where they belong and allow them to start moving in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="c8">The junction between the esophagus and the stomach is an area that is particularly susceptible to such stumbles. Despite safety measures that include a narrow esophagus, a steadied position in the diaphragm, and the curve at the entrance to the stomach, things sometimes still go wrong. Around a quarter of people in Europe regularly experience such problems. This <a id="page_94" class="calibre2"></a>is not just another modern fad: nomadic people, whose way of life has not changed for hundreds of years, have similar rates of heartburn and reflux to Europeans, although rates are thought to be on the rise in the United States.</p>
<p class="c8">The crux of the matter is that two different nervous systems have to work together in the esophagus and stomach area—the nervous system of the brain and that of the gut. For example, the sphincter muscle between the esophagus and the stomach is under the control of nerves from the brain. The brain also influences gastric acid production. The nerves of the digestive tract ensure that the esophagus moves things downward in a harmonious stadium-style wave, keeping it clean with the thousand-or-so times we swallow saliva over the course of a day.</p>
<p class="c8">Practical tips to help with heartburn and reflux are based on trying to get those two nervous systems back on the right path. Chewing gum or sipping tea can help the digestive tract because small, repeated swallows help nudge the nerves in the right direction—down toward the stomach, not back up. Relaxation techniques can help persuade the brain not to send out such hectic instructions via the nerves. In a best-case scenario, that should result in constant closure of the sphincter, leading to less acid production.</p>
<p class="c8">Cigarette smoke stimulates areas of the brain that are also activated by eating. This may lead to a sense of satisfaction, but it also tricks the brain into producing more gastric acid for no practical reason, as well as causing the sphincter between the esophagus and the stomach to relax. This is why giving up smoking often helps reduce reflux and heartburn complaints.</p>
<p class="c8">Pregnancy hormones can cause similar disarray. Their intended function is to keep the womb relaxed and cozy for the unborn baby, but they also have a similar effect on the sphincter of the esophagus. The result is a leaky connection to the stomach, which, combined with the pressure of the bulging <a id="page_95" class="calibre2"></a>belly from below, causes acid to rise. Contraceptives containing female hormones can cause reflux as a side effect.</p>
<p class="c8">Cigarette smoke or pregnancy hormones—our nerves are not like fully insulated electric cables. They are embedded organically in our tissues and react to the substances around them. That’s why many doctors recommend avoiding foodstuffs that can reduce the strength of the sealing sphincter: chocolate, hot spices, alcohol, sugary sweets, coffee, and so on.</p>
<p class="c8">All these substances influence our nerves, but they do not necessarily cause an acid stomach stumble in everybody. The results of American studies indicate each individual should use trial and error to find out which foods affect their nerves, rather than unnecessarily cutting out everything that might be the culprit.</p>
<p class="c8">There is an interesting connection discovered by means of a drug that was never approved because of its side effects. This substance blocks nerves at a location where glutamate normally binds with them. Most people are familiar with glutamate as a flavor enhancer, but it is also released by our nerves. In the nerves of the tongue, glutamate causes an intensification of taste signals. This can create confusion in the stomach, since the nerves do not know whether the glutamate originates from their colleagues elsewhere in the body or from the local Chinese takeaway. The trial-and-error test here would involve avoiding food rich in glutamate for a while. To do this, you will have to take your reading glasses to the supermarket to check those lists of ingredients in tiny print on food labels. Often, glutamate hides behind more complicated formulations such as monosodium glutamate or something similar. If avoiding it results in an improvement—fine. If not, at least you will have eaten more healthily for a while.</p>
<p class="c8">Those whose stomach stumbles less than once a week can turn to simple remedies for relief, such as antacids from the <a id="page_96" class="calibre2"></a>pharmacy or household cures like raw potato juice. Neutralizing stomach acid should not be used as a long-term strategy, however. Stomach acid is useful for combating the harmful effects of allergens and bacteria from our food, and is instrumental in digesting proteins. What is more, some antacid medications contain aluminum, which is a very alien substance for our body to deal with. So, overuse of antacids should be avoided. Always read and follow the instructions on the leaflet.</p>
<p class="c8">Reliance on antacids for four weeks or more should be seen as a warning sign. Anyone who ignores such warnings will soon feel the wrath of a disgruntled stomach that wants its acid back—to make up for the effects of the medication for one thing, but also to return to its natural acidic state. Antacids are never a long-term solution for reflux and certainly not for other acidic phenomena, such as gastritis, which is the medical name for an inflammation of the lining of the stomach.</p>
<p class="c8">When symptoms continue despite the use of antacids, doctors must get creative to find out why. If blood tests and a thorough physical examination yield no abnormal results, a doctor may prescribe a drug called a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. PPIS inhibit the production of acid and its secretion into the stomach. Short-term use of a PI may leave the stomach lacking a little acid, but for those who suffer from heartburn or reflux, they provide a short respite for the stomach and the esophagus so that they can recover from the effects of such acid attacks.</p>
<p class="c8">If attacks strike mainly at night, it is a good idea to try propping the upper body up to an angle of 30 degrees. This can involve complex pillow constructions and the use of a protractor at bedtime, but specially manufactured pillows are also available from specialist suppliers. Incidentally, a 30-degree upper body inclination is also good for the cardiovascular system. My old physiology professor never tired of telling us this, <a id="page_97" class="calibre2"></a>and, given that his specialty is cardiovascular research, I am more than inclined to believe him. But it also means I now can’t help imagining him propped up in bed every time someone mentions his name.</p>
<p class="c8">Patients <em class="calibre8">should</em> lose sleep over such serious warning signs as difficulty swallowing, weight loss, swelling, or any sign of blood. When such symptoms appear, it is high time for an exploratory expedition into the stomach with a camera—no matter how unpleasant an experience that can be. The real danger with reflux comes not, in fact, from burning acid, but from bile reaching the esophagus from the small intestine via the stomach. Bile does not cause a burning sensation, but it has much more insidious effects than acid. Luckily, for most people who suffer from reflux, there is very little bile involved.</p>
<p class="c8">The presence of bile can seriously confuse the cells of the esophagus. Suddenly, they are no longer sure where they are, thinking, “Am I really an esophagus cell? I keep sensing bile! Perhaps I’ve really been a small intestine cell all these years without realizing it . . . Silly me!” Anxious to do the right thing, they change from esophagus cells into gastrointestinal cells. That can cause problems. Mutating cells can make mistakes in their own programing and no longer grow in a controlled way like other cells. However, this has serious repercussions for only a small percentage of people who suffer from stomach stumbles.</p>
<p class="c8">In the vast majority of cases, reflux and heartburn are stumbles that are unpleasant but not dangerous. When we stumble while walking, we usually briefly adjust our clothing, neutralize the shock with a shake of the head, and walk on at a measured pace. The same reaction is appropriate in the case of an acid stumble of the stomach—a couple of mouthfuls of water for adjustment, neutralize the acid if necessary, and then continue walking, perhaps at a less hectic pace.</p>
