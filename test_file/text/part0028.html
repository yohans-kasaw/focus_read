<p class="c7"><strong class="calibre6">S</strong><small class="calibre7">OMETIMES IT IS</small> not necessary to understand our desires and cravings. If a person occasionally enjoys rolling around on their living-room floor for no apparent reason, let them. However, it can sometimes be both useful and interesting to find out why we develop the desire to eat and drink what we do.</p>
<p class="c8">Take a glass of water and add an equal amount of sugar to that contained in the same volume of cola. Few people would want to drink the resulting mixture. And if we did, we would probably feel disgust at the idea of downing a second glass. This is because our bodies are cleverer than we think.</p>
<p class="c8">If we now do something that several million years of evolution has not been able to prepare us for, the experiment ends with a very different result. If we add a little citric acid to the sugar water (represented by carbonic and phosphoric acid in cola)—hey presto! We have a delicious drink. We down the glass in one gulp, and our brain claps its hands in delight: hooray!</p>
<p class="c8">Our bodies are familiar with acid, from fruit and good bacteria (for example, the lactic acid bacteria in yogurt). When the acid is not too strong and comes in combination with other nutrients, it gains the trust of our taste buds. Thus we like to <a id="page_276" class="calibre2"></a>include an acid component when we cook a pleasant-tasting meal—tomatoes in the sauce, a squeeze of lemon over the fish, a glug of wine over the frying onions. This well-placed pleasure is fascinating for anyone with an interest in microbes. A pertinent question might be: when we fancy a sour ingredient in our meal, are we really craving good bacteria?</p>
<p class="c8">Down the millennia of history, anyone with a yen for a taste of sour would satisfy their hunger with good microbes. Our forebears fermented cabbage to create sauerkraut and drank wine rather than water (which was usually too contaminated to drink untreated in the Middle Ages). They still baked their bread using real sourdough, and made their own sour milk and yogurt products. They did not have access to citrus fruits or acidified carbonated drinks. This observation gives cause for a little experiment you can carry out for yourself.</p>
<p class="c19"><strong class="calibre4">Fermenting Vegetables with Bacteria at<br class="calibre10"/> Home—AKA Making Sauerkraut</strong></p>
<p class="c7"><small class="calibre7">FERMENTING MEANS GETTING</small> bacteria to pre-digest your food. Bad bacteria and molds do not ferment your food nicely, but spoil it and render it inedible. Good bacteria, however, process our food to make it easier for us to digest. They are better than our digestive enzymes at splitting open cabbage cells (or other plant cells). In this way, they make the work of the gut much easier and even produce additional vitamins in the process. They also produce acids that kill off any dangerous bacteria, thus preserving the food for longer. Since good bacteria are everywhere, just hanging around in the environment, it makes sense to provide them with a useful job to do and something to eat. This helps them multiply and gain more power.</p>
<p class="c9"><a id="page_277" class="calibre1"></a><img src="../images/00050.jpeg" class="width" alt=""/></p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32"><a id="page_278" class="calibre2"></a>1.</span>Cabbage is the classic, but almost any vegetable that can be eaten raw can also be fermented. Carrots and gherkins, for example (gherkins are the pinnacle of pickling, however, as precise procedures must be followed if they are to remain crisp to the bite). Some good bacteria will already be on the cabbage leaves or the skin of the carrots, so there is no need to add any particular bacteria to them. This is why it can be beneficial to buy vegetables that have not been treated with pesticides, etc.</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">2.</span>Depending on how long you want the fermentation process to take, slice your vegetables thinly or grate them (= one week’s fermentation time) or leave them whole (= four to six weeks’ fermentation time). You need to make sure you avoid contamination as you work. You don’t want just any old kitchen bacteria joining your product in the jar.</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">3.</span>Add one-third of an ounce to half an ounce (10 to 15 grams) of salt for every 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) of vegetables. This slows the growth of bacteria in general, preventing bad germs from commandeering the process before the good ones can do their work. It is important to add the correct amount of salt: too much will prevent the fermentation process altogether; too little can result in the food going off and tasting bad. Sea salt is a good choice, but do not use iodized salt under any circumstances as the iodine inhibits the bacteria’s growth too much.</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">4.</span>Knead the mixture with appropriate fervor. This is to thoroughly mix the salt into the concoction and to help partially break down particularly tough cell walls. The salt helps extract the water from the cabbage cells, which can be used later as the pickling liquid.</p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c32">5.</span>Press the cabbage firmly into a jar with an airtight seal. It is important to make sure that all the vegetable matter is submerged beneath the liquid so that it is not exposed to oxygen, <a id="page_279" class="calibre2"></a>which disturbs the fermenting bacteria. Any parts that stick out above the liquid will not be protected by the acid and could go moldy. If your cabbage or carrots have not produced enough liquid of their own to cover them completely, you can add more salted water. Add a generous teaspoon of salt for every 0.85 ounces (250 ml) of water. If there is still some vegetable matter sticking out above the surface of the liquid, you can add a weight to press it down. (Special “sauerkraut weights” are available, in Germany, at least!—but a rock or stone of the right size that has been cleaned by boiling it in water will do the job just as well.) Those who prefer a particular flavor to their sauerkraut can now add almost anything they want to the jar, such as caraway seeds, beetroot, or, particularly good with carrots, a little ginger.</p>
<p class="c30">YOU MAY SOMETIMES see little bubbles of gas rising through the liquid as the fermentation process progresses. This is why people in ancient cultures, who had no knowledge of the microbial world, would sometimes dance around the fermentation vats, as they thought this would encourage the vegetables to bubble. Others, by contrast, would afford the barrels calm so as not to disturb the gods in their work. Once fermentation is complete and everything is ready, the result should taste sour, and should not be slimy in consistency or taste too strongly of alcohol. From this stage, it can be kept in the fridge.</p>
<p class="c8">Incidentally, it is at this stage that the sauerkraut you buy from the supermarket is boiled to pasteurize it. This not only kills off the bacteria, but it also destroys some of the vitamin C they have produced. Manufacturers therefore often add vitamin C powder after pasteurization. The acid it relies on means that fermentation is the safest way to preserve food—canned or bottled foods have been known to cause illness due to <a id="page_280" class="calibre2"></a>temperature-resistant bacteria, but no case of illness caused by fermented foods has ever been reported.</p>
<p class="c8">You can now add a spoon or two of your homemade sauerkraut or sour carrots to just about any meal: in salad instead of vinegar, on a burger instead of gherkin pickled in vinegar, in soups and stews (add just before serving), with vegetable or rice dishes, or, for those feeling particularly adventurous, with some honey in your breakfast porridge. Then just wait and see if you start craving this special “sourness” more and more. When your appetite decides it likes something after trying it once or twice—you might as well go with it.</p>
